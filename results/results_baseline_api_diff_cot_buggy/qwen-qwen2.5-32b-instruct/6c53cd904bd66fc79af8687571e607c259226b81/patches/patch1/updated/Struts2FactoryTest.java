1. The class `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` has been moved from `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.ng.filter` to `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.filter`.
2. The constructor `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter()` has been removed, so we need to ensure that the binding and filter configuration do not rely on this constructor.
3. Update the import statement to reflect the new package location.
4. Ensure that the binding and filter configuration are updated to use the new class location.
5. No additional imports are needed beyond updating the import statement.
