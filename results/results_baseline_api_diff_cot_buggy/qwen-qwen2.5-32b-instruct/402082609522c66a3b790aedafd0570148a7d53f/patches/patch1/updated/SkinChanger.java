1. The class `CommandSource` and `TextSerializers` have been removed in the new version of the dependency.
2. The new API version does not provide direct replacements for these classes, so we need to find alternative ways to achieve the same functionality.
3. We need to update the client code to use alternative methods or classes that provide similar functionality.
4. We must ensure that the changes do not alter the function signatures and that the code remains functional.
5. The minimal changes needed are to replace the usage of `CommandSource` and `TextSerializers` with alternative methods or classes.
6. Potential side effects include changes in behavior if the alternative methods do not provide the exact same functionality.
7. The planned changes will result in a complete and compilable class.
8. Additional imports may be needed if alternative classes are used.
