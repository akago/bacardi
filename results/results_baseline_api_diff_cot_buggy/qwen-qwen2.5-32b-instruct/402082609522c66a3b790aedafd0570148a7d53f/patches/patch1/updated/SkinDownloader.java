1. The class `CommandSource` has been removed from the new version of the dependency.
2. The client code uses `CommandSource` in the constructor and as a field.
3. We need to replace `CommandSource` with a compatible type or remove its usage if not necessary.
4. We will replace `CommandSource` with `Player` as a temporary solution, assuming `Player` can replace `CommandSource` in the context of the code.
5. We will update the constructor and field accordingly.
6. We will remove the import statement for `CommandSource` and add the import for `Player` if necessary.
7. We will ensure the class compiles and remains functional.
