```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    SpongeCommandSpec buildSpec();
}

class SpongeCommandSpec {
    // Placeholder class to replace the removed CommandSpec.
    // This class should be implemented with the necessary methods and fields
    // as per the new API guidelines.
}
```

Note: The above solution introduces a placeholder class `SpongeCommandSpec` to replace the removed `CommandSpec`. This is a temporary fix to resolve the compilation errors. The actual implementation of `SpongeCommandSpec` should be based on the new API guidelines provided by the updated dependency.
