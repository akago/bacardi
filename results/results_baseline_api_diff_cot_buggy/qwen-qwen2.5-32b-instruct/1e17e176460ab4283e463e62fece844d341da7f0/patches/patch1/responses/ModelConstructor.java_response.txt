1. The error is caused by the removal of the constructor `Constructor(Class<T>)` in the new version of the SnakeYAML library.
2. The new version of the library requires a `LoaderOptions` parameter in the constructor.
3. The client code needs to be updated to use the new constructor that accepts `LoaderOptions`.
4. The `LoaderOptions` instance can be created with default settings.
5. The minimal change is to add the `LoaderOptions` parameter to the constructor call.
6. No side effects are expected as the default settings should be compatible with the existing code.
7. The class should compile and function as before, with the updated constructor call.
8. No additional imports are needed as the `LoaderOptions` class is part of the SnakeYAML library.
