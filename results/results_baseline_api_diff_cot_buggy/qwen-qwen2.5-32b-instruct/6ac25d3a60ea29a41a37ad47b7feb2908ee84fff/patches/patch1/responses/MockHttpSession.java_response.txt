1. The class `HttpSessionContext` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
2. The method `getSessionContext()` in the `HttpSession` interface has been deprecated and removed.
3. The client code needs to remove the implementation of `getSessionContext()` and the import statement for `HttpSessionContext`.
4. No additional imports are needed.
5. The minimal set of changes includes removing the `getSessionContext()` method and the import statement for `HttpSessionContext`.
6. Removing the `getSessionContext()` method and its import should not affect other parts of the code since the method is deprecated and no longer exists in the new API.
7. The class will remain compilable and functional after the changes.
