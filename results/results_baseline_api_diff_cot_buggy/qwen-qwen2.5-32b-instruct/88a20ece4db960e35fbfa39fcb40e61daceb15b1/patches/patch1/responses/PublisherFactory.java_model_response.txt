```java
<repair_strategy>
1. The class `PublishMetadata` has been removed from the new version of the dependency.
2. The method `newPublisher` uses `PublishMetadata` as a type parameter, which is no longer available.
3. The import statement for `PublishMetadata` is no longer valid.
4. The fix should replace `PublishMetadata` with a type that is still available in the new version of the dependency.
5. The minimal change would be to replace `PublishMetadata` with a generic type or a type that is still supported by the new version of the dependency.
6. The fix should ensure that the method signature remains compatible with the rest of the codebase.
7. The import statement for `PublishMetadata` should be removed or replaced with a valid import.
8. No additional imports are needed if a generic type is used.
