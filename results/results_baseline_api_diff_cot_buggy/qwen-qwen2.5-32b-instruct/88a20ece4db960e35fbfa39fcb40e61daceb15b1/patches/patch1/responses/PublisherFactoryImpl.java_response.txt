1. The class `PublishMetadata` has been removed, so we need to update the return type of `newPublisher` to a compatible type.
2. The `PartitionPublisherFactory` interface has been removed, so we need to find an alternative way to set up the publisher factory.
3. The `setContext` method has been removed from several builders, so we need to remove these calls.
4. The `TopicPath.Builder` method has been removed, so we need to directly set the fields on the `TopicPath` object.
5. We need to ensure that the updated code still compiles and adheres to the new API.
