1. The class `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` has been moved from `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.ng.filter` to `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.filter`.
2. The constructor `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter()` has been removed, so we need to use the new class location and ensure no direct instantiation is required.
3. Update the import statements and class references to reflect the new location of `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter`.
4. Ensure that the updated code still binds and filters correctly with the new class location.
5. No additional imports are needed beyond updating the import statement.
6. The changes should not affect other parts of the code as they are isolated to the import and class reference.
7. The class should compile and function correctly with the new dependency version.
