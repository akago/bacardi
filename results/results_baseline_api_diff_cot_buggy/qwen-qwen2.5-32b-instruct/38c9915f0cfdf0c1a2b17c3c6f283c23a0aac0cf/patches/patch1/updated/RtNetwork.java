1. The error is caused by the removal of the `IoCheckedScalar` class in the new version of the `org.cactoos.scalar` package.
2. The old API used `IoCheckedScalar` to handle exceptions in a functional way, but this class is no longer available.
3. The client code needs to be updated to handle exceptions in a different way, possibly by using a try-catch block or another utility class from the updated dependency.
4. The fix should not change the function signatures of the methods in the `RtNetwork` class.
5. The minimal set of changes needed is to replace the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` with a try-catch block or another utility class that can handle exceptions.
6. The proposed changes should not affect other parts of the code, as the exception handling is localized to the `pull` method.
7. The changes will result in a complete and compilable class.
8. Additional imports may be needed if a new utility class is used.
