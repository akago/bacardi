### Analysis

The errors are caused by the removal of the `getInstance()` method from the `JAXBToStringStrategy` class in the new version of the dependency. This method is used to obtain an instance of `JAXBToStringStrategy` for generating string representations of objects. Since this method no longer exists, the code fails to compile.

#### Proposed Fixes
Instead the `getInstance()` method, we can create a new instance of `JAXBToStringStrategy` directly. This can be done by replacing `JAXBToStringStrategy.getInstance()` with `new JAXBToStringStrategy()`.

#### Potential Side Effects
- The new instance will not be shared across the application, which might have performance implications if the strategy is used extensively. However, since the method was removed, this is the best alternative.
- The code will now create a new instance each time, which might be less efficient but is necessary due to the API change.

- The `@Override` annotation should be removed from the `toString` and `appendFields` methods since the methods no longer override methods from the updated dependency version.

- Ensure that the correct package or class is used in accordance with the new dependency version.

- No existing code should be removed unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
