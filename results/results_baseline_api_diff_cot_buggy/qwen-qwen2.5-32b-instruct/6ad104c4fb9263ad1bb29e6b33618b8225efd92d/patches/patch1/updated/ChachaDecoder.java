1. The error is due to the removal of the `AlertDescription` and `TlsFatalAlert` classes in the new version of the BouncyCastle library.
2. The `TlsFatalAlert` class is used to throw an exception when a bad record MAC is detected.
3. The `AlertDescription` class is used to provide the description of the alert.
4. The fix should replace the usage of `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription` with a custom exception or a different approach to handle the bad record MAC scenario.
5. The fix should ensure that the code remains functional and compilable.
6. The fix should not change the function signatures and should maintain the overall structure of the class.
7. The fix should remove the import statements related to `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription` and replace them with a custom exception or a different approach.
