<fix_planning>
a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
   - The class `PublishMetadata` has been removed from the package `com.google.cloud.pubsublite`.
   - The import statement `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;` and the usage of `PublishMetadata` in the `PublisherFactory` interface are causing the errors.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
   - Removal of the `PublishMetadata` class and its constructor.

c. Affected lines of code:
   - Line 10: `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
   - Line 18: `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`

d. Potential fixes:
   - Remove the import statement for `PublishMetadata` since the class no longer exists.
   - Replace `PublishMetadata` with a generic type or another appropriate type that is compatible with the new version of the dependency.

e. Potential side effects:
   - Removing `PublishMetadata` may require changes in the implementation of the `PublisherFactory` interface, depending on how `PublishMetadata` was used in the original code.

f. Adherence to constraints:
   - The function signature of `newPublisher` will remain unchanged, only the type parameter will be modified.
   - No existing code will be removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
   - The import statement for `PublishMetadata` will be removed as it no longer exists.

g. Summary of the chosen fix:
   - The chosen fix is to replace `PublishMetadata` with `Void` as a placeholder, assuming that the actual type should be determined based on the new API documentation or the context of the application. This change will allow the code to compile and run without errors, pending further adjustments based on the new API.
