> 1. The class `PublishMetadata` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
> 2. The method `newPublisher` uses `PublishMetadata` as a type parameter, which is no longer available.
> 3. The client code needs to be updated to use a different type parameter that is compatible with the new version of the dependency.
> 4. The function signature of `newPublisher` cannot be changed.
> 5. The minimal change would be to replace `PublishMetadata` with a compatible type from the new dependency version.
> 6. The change should not affect other parts of the code.
> 7. Ensure the class is compilable.
> 8. No additional imports are needed if a compatible type is found within the same package.
