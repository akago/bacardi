1. The error is caused by the removal of the class `javax.mvc.RedirectScoped` and the introduction of `jakarta.mvc.RedirectScoped`.
2. The client code needs to update the import statement and the annotation usage to reflect the new package structure.
3. The minimal change required is to update the import statement and the annotation to use the new package.
4. No function signatures need to be changed, and no additional imports are required beyond updating the existing one.
5. The change should not affect other parts of the code as it only involves updating the import and annotation.
6. The class should remain fully compilable after the changes.
