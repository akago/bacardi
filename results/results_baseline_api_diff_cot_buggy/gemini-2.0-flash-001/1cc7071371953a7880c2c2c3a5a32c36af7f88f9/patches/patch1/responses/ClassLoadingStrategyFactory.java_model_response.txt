The code uses `org.assertj.core.internal.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector` and `org.assertj.core.internal.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy`, which have been removed in the updated dependency. The code attempts to use reflection and lookup strategies for class loading, but these strategies are no longer available in the same way.

The affected lines are:

*   `import org.assertj.core.internal.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector;`
*   `import org.assertj.core.internal.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy;`
*   `if (ClassInjector.UsingReflection.isAvailable()) {`
*   `return ClassLoadingStrategy.Default.INJECTION;`
*   `} else if (ClassInjector.UsingLookup.isAvailable() && PRIVATE_LOOKUP_IN != null) {`
*   `return ClassLoadingStrategy.UsingLookup.of(PRIVATE_LOOKUP_IN.invoke(null, assertClass, LOOKUP));`

Since `ClassInjector` and `ClassLoadingStrategy` are removed, we need to find a replacement or remove the dependency on them.  Since the goal is to load classes, we can use standard Java class loading mechanisms.  Since the code attempts to use reflection and lookup, we can try to use `ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()` as a fallback.

The `ClassLoadingStrategy` interface and its implementations are gone. We can replace the entire `classLoadingStrategy` method with a simple return of the system class loader. This will require changing the return type of the method.

Here's the proposed change:

1.  Remove the imports for `ClassInjector` and `ClassLoadingStrategy`.
2.  Change the return type of `classLoadingStrategy` to `ClassLoader`.
3.  Replace the body of `classLoadingStrategy` with `return ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader();`.

This adheres to the constraints:

*   The function signature of `classLoadingStrategy` is changed, but this is necessary because the return type `ClassLoadingStrategy<ClassLoader>` no longer exists.
*   A variable is not created.
*   The `@Override` annotation is not present, so it doesn't need to be removed.
*   The correct package or class is used for the replacement.
*   No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
*   All code is included in the final output.

Final summary: The best solution is to replace the entire `classLoadingStrategy` method with a simple return of the system class loader. This avoids the dependency on the removed `ClassInjector` and `ClassLoadingStrategy` classes and provides a basic class loading mechanism.
