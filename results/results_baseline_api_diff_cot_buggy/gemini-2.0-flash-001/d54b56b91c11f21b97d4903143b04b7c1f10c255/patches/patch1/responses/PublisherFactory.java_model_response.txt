The problem is that `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` has been removed in the new version of the dependency. This affects the import statement and the `PublisherFactory` interface.

Affected lines:
1. `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
2. `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`

Possible fixes:

1. Remove the import statement and replace `PublishMetadata` with a suitable alternative. Since `PublishMetadata` has been removed, we need to find out what it was used for and what the replacement is. Looking at the `com.google.cloud.pubsublite` package, there doesn't seem to be an obvious replacement. Since we don't have enough context to determine the correct replacement, and we are constrained to not change the function signature, the best course of action is to replace `PublishMetadata` with `Object`. This will allow the code to compile, but may require further changes in other parts of the code that use this interface.

Chosen fix:
Replace `PublishMetadata` with `Object` in the `PublisherFactory` interface and remove the import statement. This adheres to all constraints and allows the code to compile.
