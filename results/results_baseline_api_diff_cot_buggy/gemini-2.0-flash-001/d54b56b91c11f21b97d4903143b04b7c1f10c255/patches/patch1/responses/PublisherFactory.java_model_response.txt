a. Code and API changes:
- Code:
```java
import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}
```
- API Changes:
"Class com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata has been removed in the new version of the dependency."

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` class.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
- `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`

d. Proposed potential fixes:
Since `PublishMetadata` has been removed, we need to find a suitable replacement. Looking at the available classes in the `com.google.cloud.pubsublite` package, there doesn't seem to be a direct replacement. We can consider using `byte[]` or `com.google.protobuf.ByteString` as a generic representation of the published data. Let's assume that the publisher now accepts `byte[]`.

- Replace `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;` with nothing (remove the line).
- Replace `Publisher<PublishMetadata>` with `Publisher<byte[]>`.

e. Potential side effects of the proposed changes:
The change in the `Publisher` type from `PublishMetadata` to `byte[]` will require changes in the implementation of `PublisherFactory` and any classes that use it. We are only modifying the interface definition here, so the impact should be limited to the implementations.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- We are not changing the function signature, only the generic type.
- We are creating variables if it simplifies the code (not applicable here).
- We are removing the import statement because it is no longer needed.
- We are ensuring the correct package or class is used (using `byte[]` which is a standard Java type).
- We are not removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- We are including all code in our final output.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix:
The best solution is to replace `PublishMetadata` with `byte[]` as the generic type for the `Publisher`. This addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of `PublishMetadata` and provides a generic way to represent the published data.
