The errors indicate that `PublishMetadata` class and `setContext` method in `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder` are no longer available in the updated dependency.

1.  **`PublishMetadata` is removed:** The class `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` and its constructor have been removed. The `Publisher<PublishMetadata>` return type in the `newPublisher` method and the import statement `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;` are now invalid. Since we cannot change the method signature, we need to find a suitable replacement for `PublishMetadata` or change the return type to `Publisher<?>`. Since we cannot change the method signature, we will need to investigate if we can remove the generic type. However, since the `PublishMetadata` class is removed, we can remove the generic type from the `Publisher` interface.

2.  **`setContext` method is removed:** The `setContext` method has been removed from `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder`. This means the line `.setContext(PubsubContext.of(FRAMEWORK))` needs to be removed or replaced with an alternative. Since the method is removed, the best approach is to remove the line.

Here's a breakdown of the affected lines and proposed fixes:

*   **Line 20: `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`**: Remove this line as the class is no longer available.
*   **Line 36: `public Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params)`**: Change to `public Publisher<?> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params)` since `PublishMetadata` is removed.
*   **Line 53: `.setContext(PubsubContext.of(FRAMEWORK))`**: Remove this line as the `setContext` method is no longer available.

The proposed changes adhere to all constraints:

*   The function signature of `newPublisher` is not changed, only the generic type of the return type.
*   No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.

Final summary:

The best solution is to remove the import statement for `PublishMetadata`, change the return type of `newPublisher` to `Publisher<?>`, and remove the call to `setContext` in the `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder`. This addresses the API changes while adhering to the constraints.
