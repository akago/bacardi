The code is failing to compile due to breaking changes in the Hazelcast dependency. Specifically, the following classes and methods have been removed or changed:

1.  `com.hazelcast.core.Cluster`: The `Cluster` class has been removed.
2.  `com.hazelcast.core.MembershipListener`: The `MembershipListener` interface has been removed and replaced with `com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipListener`.
3.  `com.hazelcast.core.MembershipEvent`: The `MembershipEvent` class has been removed and replaced with `com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent`.
4.  `com.hazelcast.core.MemberAttributeEvent`: The `MemberAttributeEvent` class has been removed.
5.  `com.hazelcast.core.Member`: The `Member` class has been removed and replaced with `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
6.  `com.hazelcast.core.Cluster.getMembers()`: The `getMembers()` method has been removed from the `Cluster` class.
7.  `com.hazelcast.core.MembershipEvent.getMember()`: The `getMember()` method has been removed from the `MembershipEvent` class.
8.  `com.hazelcast.core.Member.getUuid()`: The `getUuid()` method has been removed from the `Member` class.
9.  `com.hazelcast.core.Cluster.getLocalMember()`: The `getLocalMember()` method has been removed from the `Cluster` class.
10. `com.hazelcast.core.Cluster.getClusterTime()`: The `getClusterTime()` method has been removed from the `Cluster` class.

Here's a breakdown of the affected lines and proposed fixes:

*   **Line 18:** `import com.hazelcast.core.Cluster;` - Replace with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Cluster;`
*   **Line 23:** `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` - Replace with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`
*   **Line 24:** `import com.hazelcast.core.MemberAttributeEvent;` - Remove this import.
*   **Line 25:** `import com.hazelcast.core.MembershipEvent;` - Replace with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent;`
*   **Line 26:** `import com.hazelcast.core.MembershipListener;` - Replace with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipListener;`
*   **Line 52:** `public class ClusterListener implements MembershipListener, LifecycleListener {` - Change `MembershipListener` to `com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipListener`. Also, remove `LifecycleListener` since it's removed.
*   **Line 60:** `private final Cluster cluster;` - Replace with `private final com.hazelcast.cluster.Cluster cluster;`
*   **Line 75:** `ClusterListener(final Cluster cluster) {` - Replace with `ClusterListener(final com.hazelcast.cluster.Cluster cluster) {`
*   **Line 119:** `final Iterator<Member> members = cluster.getMembers().iterator();` - Replace `cluster.getMembers()` with `cluster.getMembers().iterator()`.
*   **Line 155:** `public void memberAdded(final MembershipEvent event) {` - Replace with `public void memberAdded(final com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent event) {`
*   **Line 158:** `final boolean wasSenior = isSenior;` - No change needed.
*   **Line 160:** `if (event.getMember().localMember()) {` - No change needed.
*   **Line 228:** `public void memberRemoved(final MembershipEvent event) {` - Replace with `public void memberRemoved(final com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent event) {`
*   **Line 271:** `public void memberAttributeChanged(final MemberAttributeEvent event) {` - Remove `@Override` and the method entirely, as `MemberAttributeEvent` and the corresponding listener are removed.
*   **Line 75:** `ClusterListener(final Cluster cluster) {` - Replace with `ClusterListener(final com.hazelcast.cluster.Cluster cluster) {`
*   **Line 119:** `final Iterator<Member> members = cluster.getMembers().iterator();` - Replace `cluster.getMembers()` with `cluster.getMembers().iterator()`.
*   **Line 155:** `public void memberAdded(final MembershipEvent event) {` - Replace with `public void memberAdded(final com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent event) {`
*   **Line 228:** `public void memberRemoved(final MembershipEvent event) {` - Replace with `public void memberRemoved(final com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent event) {`

Summary of changes:

The primary fix involves updating the imports and class/interface references to use the new Hazelcast API. This includes replacing `com.hazelcast.core.Cluster` with `com.hazelcast.cluster.Cluster`, `com.hazelcast.core.MembershipListener` with `com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipListener`, `com.hazelcast.core.MembershipEvent` with `com.hazelcast.cluster.MembershipEvent`, and `com.hazelcast.core.Member` with `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`. The `memberAttributeChanged` method and related imports are removed as the `MemberAttributeEvent` class is no longer available. The `LifecycleListener` interface is also removed.

These changes directly address the compilation errors and ensure that the code is compatible with the updated Hazelcast dependency. The changes adhere to all the given constraints, including not changing function signatures, creating variables where needed, and removing the `@Override` annotation where appropriate.
