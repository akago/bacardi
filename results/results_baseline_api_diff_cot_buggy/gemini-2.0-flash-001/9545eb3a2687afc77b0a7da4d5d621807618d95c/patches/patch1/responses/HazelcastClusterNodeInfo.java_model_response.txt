a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `com.hazelcast.core.Member`, but this class has been removed. The new version introduces `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
- The code uses `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`, but this method has been removed.
- The code uses `member.getSocketAddress()`, but this method has been removed. The new version introduces `member.getSocketAddress()`.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- Removal of `com.hazelcast.core.Member` and introduction of `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
- Removal of `com.hazelcast.core.Member.getStringAttribute(java.lang.String)`.
- Removal of `com.hazelcast.core.Member.getSocketAddress()`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- Line 24: `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;`
- Line 41: `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
- Line 42: `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Line 24: Replace `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`
- Line 41: Replace `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {` with `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final com.hazelcast.cluster.Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
- Line 42: Since `getStringAttribute` is removed, we need to find a replacement.  Since `getAttributes()` exists, we can use it.  Also, since `getSocketAddress()` is removed, we can use `getAddress().getHost()` instead.
  Replace `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";` with `this.hostname = (String) member.getAttributes().get(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getAddress().getHost() + ")";`

e. Potential side effects:
- The type of `member` changes, which might affect other parts of the code. However, since we are only modifying the constructor, this should not be a problem.
- The replacement for `getStringAttribute` assumes that the attribute is a String. This is a safe assumption based on the code.
- The replacement for `getSocketAddress().getHostString()` uses `getAddress().getHost()`. This should be equivalent.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- We are not changing the function signature of any method except for the constructor, which is allowed.
- We are creating variables to simplify the code.
- We are removing the @Override annotation if and only if the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
- We are ensuring the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
- We are not removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
- We are including all code, even unchanged portions, in our final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to:
1. Replace `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`
2. Replace `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {` with `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final com.hazelcast.cluster.Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
3. Replace `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";` with `this.hostname = (String) member.getAttributes().get(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getAddress().getHost() + ")";`
This fixes the compilation errors and uses the new API correctly.
