a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `org.hamcrest.Matchers`.
- The API change states: "Class org.hamcrest.Matchers has been removed in the new version of the dependency."

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of the `org.hamcrest.Matchers` class.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`
- `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawPath", path)`
- `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawQuery", query)`

d. Proposed potential fixes:
- Remove the import statement `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`.
- Replace `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty(...)` with `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.<URI>hasProperty(...)` in both occurrences. This utilizes the `HasPropertyWithValue` class from `org.hamcrest.beans` which provides similar functionality.

e. Potential side effects of the proposed changes:
- The change in class might affect the behavior of the matchers, but since we are only changing the class name and the method `hasProperty` is expected to behave similarly, the risk is low.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signatures are not changed.
- Variables can be created if needed.
- The `@Override` annotation is not present, so it doesn't need to be removed.
- The correct package is used for the replacement class.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to replace `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty(...)` with `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.<URI>hasProperty(...)` and remove the import statement `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`. This addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of the `org.hamcrest.Matchers` class while maintaining the intended functionality.
