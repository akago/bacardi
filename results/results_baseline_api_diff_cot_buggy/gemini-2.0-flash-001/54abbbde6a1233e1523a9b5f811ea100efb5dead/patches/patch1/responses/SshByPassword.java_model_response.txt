<fix_planning>
a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code: `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;` and `attempts = Tv.SEVEN,`
- API Change: `Class com.jcabi.aspects.Tv has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;`
- `attempts = Tv.SEVEN,`
- `session.setServerAliveInterval((int) TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(Tv.TEN));`
- `session.setServerAliveCountMax(Tv.MILLION);`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;`: Remove this import statement.
- `attempts = Tv.SEVEN,`: Replace `Tv.SEVEN` with the integer value `7`.
- `session.setServerAliveInterval((int) TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(Tv.TEN));`: Replace `Tv.TEN` with the integer value `10`.
- `session.setServerAliveCountMax(Tv.MILLION);`: Replace `Tv.MILLION` with the integer value `1000000`.

e. Potential side effects of the proposed changes:
- Replacing `Tv.SEVEN`, `Tv.TEN`, and `Tv.MILLION` with their corresponding integer values should not have any side effects, as they were likely constants defined within the `Tv` class.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signatures of all methods remain unchanged.
- Variables are not created.
- The `@Override` annotation is not removed.
- The correct package or class is used for imports.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code, even unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix:
The best solution is to remove the import statement `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;` and replace `Tv.SEVEN` with `7`, `Tv.TEN` with `10`, and `Tv.MILLION` with `1000000`. This resolves the compilation errors caused by the removal of the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class in the updated dependency, without introducing any side effects or violating any of the given constraints.
