The problem is caused by the update of the javax.mvc dependency to jakarta.mvc. This means all the javax.mvc.* imports and usages need to be updated to jakarta.mvc.*.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and proposed solutions:

1.  **`import javax.mvc.UriRef;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.UriRef has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.UriRef has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `import javax.mvc.UriRef;`
    *   Proposed Fix: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.UriRef;`
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the import statement to align with the updated dependency.

2.  **`Models models;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.Models has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.Models has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `Models models;`
    *   Proposed Fix: Change type to `jakarta.mvc.Models models;` and import `jakarta.mvc.Models`.
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the type declaration to align with the updated dependency.

3.  **`@CsrfProtected`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.security.CsrfProtected has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtected has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `@CsrfProtected`
    *   Proposed Fix: Change to `@jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtected` and import `jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtected`.
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the annotation to align with the updated dependency.

4.  **`import javax.mvc.binding.ParamError;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.binding.ParamError has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `import javax.mvc.binding.ParamError;` and usage in `(ParamError t) -> { ... }`
    *   Proposed Fix: Remove the import statement and replace `ParamError` with a suitable alternative. Since `ParamError` is used to access the parameter name and message of a binding error, we can use `jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolation`. We need to adapt the code to use `ConstraintViolation` instead of `ParamError`.
    *   Side Effects: Requires changing the error handling logic within the `post` method.
    *   Constraint adherence: Addresses the removed class by using an alternative approach.

5.  **`import javax.mvc.security.CsrfProtected;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.security.CsrfProtected has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtected has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `import javax.mvc.security.CsrfProtected;`
    *   Proposed Fix: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtected;`
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the import statement to align with the updated dependency.

6.  **`import javax.mvc.binding.MvcBinding;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.binding.MvcBinding has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.binding.MvcBinding has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `import javax.mvc.binding.MvcBinding;`
    *   Proposed Fix: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.binding.MvcBinding;`
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the import statement to align with the updated dependency.

7.  **`import javax.mvc.binding.BindingResult;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.binding.BindingResult has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `import javax.mvc.binding.BindingResult;`
    *   Proposed Fix: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.binding.BindingResult;`
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the import statement to align with the updated dependency.

8.  **`BindingResult bindingResult;`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.binding.BindingResult has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `BindingResult bindingResult;`
    *   Proposed Fix: Change type to `jakarta.mvc.binding.BindingResult bindingResult;`
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the type declaration to align with the updated dependency.

9.  **`@Controller`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.Controller has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.Controller has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `@Controller`
    *   Proposed Fix: Change to `@jakarta.mvc.Controller` and import `jakarta.mvc.Controller`.
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the annotation to align with the updated dependency.

10. **`@MvcBinding`**:
    *   API Change: `Class javax.mvc.binding.MvcBinding has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.binding.MvcBinding has been added in the new version of the dependency.`
    *   Affected Line: `@MvcBinding`
    *   Proposed Fix: Change to `@jakarta.mvc.binding.MvcBinding` and import `jakarta.mvc.binding.MvcBinding`.
    *   Side Effects: None.
    *   Constraint adherence: Corrects the annotation to align with the updated dependency.

Summary:
The primary fix involves replacing `javax.mvc.*` imports and usages with `jakarta.mvc.*`. The only exception is the removal of `javax.mvc.binding.ParamError`, which requires adapting the error handling logic to use `jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolation` instead.
