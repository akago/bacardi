a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses classes from the `javax.mvc.event` package, which has been replaced by `jakarta.mvc.event`.
- Specifically, `javax.mvc.event.BeforeControllerEvent`, `javax.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent`, `javax.mvc.event.AfterControllerEvent`, `javax.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent`, and `javax.mvc.event.ControllerRedirectEvent` have been replaced by their `jakarta.mvc.event` counterparts.
- The `javax.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent.getEngine()` method has been removed.
- The `javax.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent.getEngine()` method has been removed.

b. API changes causing the issue:
- Package change from `javax.mvc.event` to `jakarta.mvc.event`.
- Removal of `getEngine()` from `javax.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent` and `javax.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.mvc.event.BeforeControllerEvent;`
- `import javax.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent;`
- `import javax.mvc.event.AfterControllerEvent;`
- `import javax.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent;`
- `import javax.mvc.event.ControllerRedirectEvent;`
- `private void onControllerMatched(@Observes BeforeControllerEvent event)`
- `private void onViewEngineSelected(@Observes BeforeProcessViewEvent event)`
- `private void onAfterControllerEvent(@Observes AfterControllerEvent event)`
- `private void onAfterProcessViewEvent(@Observes AfterProcessViewEvent event)`
- `private void onControllerRedirectEvent(@Observes ControllerRedirectEvent event)`
- `LOGGER.info(() -> "View engine: " + event.getEngine());` (appears twice)

d. Proposed fixes:
- Replace `javax.mvc.event.*` imports with `jakarta.mvc.event.*` imports.
- Replace `BeforeControllerEvent`, `BeforeProcessViewEvent`, `AfterControllerEvent`, `AfterProcessViewEvent`, and `ControllerRedirectEvent` with their `jakarta.mvc.event` counterparts in method parameters.
- Remove `event.getEngine()` from `onViewEngineSelected` and `onAfterProcessViewEvent` methods and adjust the log message accordingly. Since `getEngine()` is available in the new `jakarta.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent` and `jakarta.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent`, we can use it.

e. Potential side effects:
- Changing the imports and class names might affect other parts of the application if they rely on the old classes. However, since the task is to fix the compilation errors caused by the dependency update, this is the correct approach.
- Removing `event.getEngine()` will change the log message.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signatures are not changed.
- Variables are not created.
- The `@Override` annotation is not used.
- The correct package is used for the imports.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace the `javax.mvc.event` imports with `jakarta.mvc.event` imports, update the class names in the method parameters, and use `event.getEngine()` in the `onViewEngineSelected` and `onAfterProcessViewEvent` methods. This addresses the compilation errors caused by the dependency update while adhering to all the given constraints.
