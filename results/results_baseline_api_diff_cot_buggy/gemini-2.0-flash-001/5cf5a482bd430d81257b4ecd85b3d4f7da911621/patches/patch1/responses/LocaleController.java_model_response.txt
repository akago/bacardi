a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code:
  ```java
  import javax.mvc.MvcContext;
  import javax.mvc.Controller;
  import javax.mvc.Models;

  @Controller
  public class LocaleController {
      @Inject
      MvcContext mvc;

      @Inject
      Models models;
  }
  ```
- API Changes:
  ```
  Interface jakarta.mvc.Controller has been added in the new version of the dependency.
  Class javax.mvc.Controller has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
  Interface jakarta.mvc.Models has been added in the new version of the dependency.
  Class javax.mvc.Models has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
  Class javax.mvc.MvcContext has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
  ```

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The classes `javax.mvc.Controller`, `javax.mvc.Models`, and `javax.mvc.MvcContext` have been removed and replaced with interfaces in the `jakarta.mvc` package.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `@Controller`
- `Models models;`
- `MvcContext mvc;`
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`
- `import javax.mvc.Controller;`
- `import javax.mvc.Models;`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- `@Controller`: Replace `javax.mvc.Controller` with `jakarta.mvc.Controller`.
- `Models models;`: Replace `javax.mvc.Models` with `jakarta.mvc.Models`.
- `MvcContext mvc;`:  `MvcContext` has been removed. Need to find a replacement. After researching, `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` is the replacement.
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.MvcContext;`.
- `import javax.mvc.Controller;`: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.Controller;`.
- `import javax.mvc.Models;`: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.Models;`.

e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
The change in package names should not have any side effects as long as the correct imports are updated. The replacement of the classes with interfaces should not cause any issues as the code only uses the interfaces.

f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
1. The function signatures are not changed.
2. No variables are created unnecessarily.
3. The `@Override` annotation is not used.
4. The correct package names are used for the imports.
5. No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
6. All code is included in the final output.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
The best solution is to replace the `javax.mvc` imports and annotations with their `jakarta.mvc` counterparts. This directly addresses the API changes and resolves the compilation errors.
