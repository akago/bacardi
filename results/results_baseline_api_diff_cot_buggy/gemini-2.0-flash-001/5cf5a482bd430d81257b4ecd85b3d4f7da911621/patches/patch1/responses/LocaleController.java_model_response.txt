a. Code and API changes:
- Code:
```java
import javax.mvc.Controller;
import javax.mvc.Models;
import javax.mvc.MvcContext;
Models models;
@Controller
MvcContext mvc;
```
- API Changes:
```
Class javax.mvc.Models has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
Interface jakarta.mvc.Models has been added in the new version of the dependency.
Interface jakarta.mvc.Controller has been added in the new version of the dependency.
Class javax.mvc.Controller has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
Class javax.mvc.MvcContext has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
```

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The classes `javax.mvc.Models`, `javax.mvc.Controller`, and `javax.mvc.MvcContext` have been removed and replaced with `jakarta.mvc.Models` and `jakarta.mvc.Controller`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.mvc.Controller;`
- `import javax.mvc.Models;`
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`
- `Models models;`
- `@Controller`
- `MvcContext mvc;`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Replace `import javax.mvc.Controller;` with `import jakarta.mvc.Controller;`
- Replace `import javax.mvc.Models;` with `import jakarta.mvc.Models;`
- Remove `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;` and the field `MvcContext mvc;` since there is no replacement. The `getLocale()` method should be available through `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Context` and `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest`.
- Replace `Models models;` with `jakarta.mvc.Models models;`
- Replace `@Controller` with `@jakarta.mvc.Controller`

e. Potential side effects:
- Removing `MvcContext mvc;` requires finding an alternative way to access the locale.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of the `get()` method remains unchanged.
- Variables are created if it simplifies the code.
- The `@Override` annotation is not present, so it doesn't need to be removed.
- The correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
- All code, even unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to replace the `javax.mvc` imports and annotations with their `jakarta.mvc` equivalents. Since `MvcContext` is removed, we will remove the import and the field. The locale can be retrieved from `HttpServletRequest` which can be injected.
