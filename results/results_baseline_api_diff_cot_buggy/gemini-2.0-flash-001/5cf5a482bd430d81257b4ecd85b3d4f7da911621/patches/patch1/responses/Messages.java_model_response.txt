a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `javax.mvc.MvcContext`.
- The API change states: "Class javax.mvc.MvcContext has been removed in the new version of the dependency."

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of `javax.mvc.MvcContext` is the direct cause of the compilation error.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`
- `private MvcContext mvcContext;`
- `final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, mvcContext.getLocale());`

d. Proposed fixes:
1. Remove the import statement `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;` and the field `private MvcContext mvcContext;`. This will require finding an alternative way to obtain the locale.
2. Replace `mvcContext.getLocale()` with a different way to obtain the locale. Since `MvcContext` is no longer available, we need to find another way to get the locale. A common approach is to inject `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` and use `request.getLocale()`.

e. Potential side effects:
1. Removing `MvcContext` might affect other parts of the application if they also rely on it. However, based on the provided code, the only usage is to get the locale.
2. Using `HttpServletRequest` directly introduces a dependency on the Servlet API.

f. Adherence to constraints:
1. The function signature of `get(String key)` remains unchanged.
2. We might need to create a new variable for `HttpServletRequest`.
3. We will remove the import statement for `javax.mvc.MvcContext`.
4. We will add an import statement for `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest`.
5. We are only removing code that directly causes a compilation error.
6. All code will be included in the final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to replace the usage of `MvcContext` with `HttpServletRequest` to obtain the locale. This involves injecting `HttpServletRequest`, removing the `MvcContext` injection, and updating the `get` method to use `request.getLocale()`. This approach addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of `MvcContext` while adhering to the given constraints.
