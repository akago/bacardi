a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code:
```java
import javax.mvc.MvcContext;

@Inject
private MvcContext mvcContext;
```
- API Changes:
`Class javax.mvc.MvcContext has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of `javax.mvc.MvcContext` causes a compilation error because the `Messages` class depends on it.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`
- `private MvcContext mvcContext;`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
1. Remove the import statement `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`.
2. Remove the field `private MvcContext mvcContext;`.
3. Modify the `get` method to obtain the locale from a different source, since `MvcContext` is no longer available.  A possible alternative is to inject `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` and use `request.getLocale()`.

e. Potential side effects of the proposed changes:
- Removing the `MvcContext` dependency will require a different way to obtain the locale. Using `HttpServletRequest` introduces a dependency on the Servlet API.
- The functionality of the `get` method must remain the same, i.e., it should still return the correct translation based on the request locale.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of the `get` method must not change.
- The proposed changes should address the compilation error caused by the missing `MvcContext` class.
- All code, even unchanged portions, must be included in the final output.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix:
The best solution is to remove the `MvcContext` dependency and use `HttpServletRequest` to obtain the locale. This involves:
1. Removing the import statement `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`.
2. Removing the field `private MvcContext mvcContext;`.
3. Injecting `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` and using `request.getLocale()` in the `get` method.
This approach addresses the compilation error and maintains the functionality of the `get` method while adhering to the given constraints.
