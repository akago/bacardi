a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext`.
- The API changes indicate that `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` have been removed.
- The API changes indicate that `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` have been added.
- The method `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext.getUriInfo()` has been removed and `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext.getUriInfo()` has been added.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` and the addition of `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` are causing compilation errors due to the missing classes.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver;`
- `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext;`
- `public class QueryParamLocaleResolver implements LocaleResolver {`
- `public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context) {`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver`.
- Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext`.
- Update the imports accordingly.
- Since the interface has changed, the @Override annotation might need to be removed if the method signature has changed. However, in this case, the method signature remains the same, so the @Override annotation can stay.

e. Potential side effects:
- The change in package names should not have any side effects as long as the new package is available in the classpath.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The proposed changes only modify the client code.
- The function signature of the `resolveLocale` method is not changed.
- The `@Override` annotation is kept because the method still overrides a method from the interface.
- The correct package is used for the imports.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace the `javax.mvc.locale` imports with `jakarta.mvc.locale` imports. This resolves the compilation errors caused by the API changes.
