<fix_planning>
a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `com.hazelcast.core.Member`, which has been removed. The new version uses `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
- The code uses `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`, which has been removed.
- The code uses `member.getSocketAddress()`, which is now in `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- Removal of `com.hazelcast.core.Member` and introduction of `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
- Removal of `com.hazelcast.core.Member.getStringAttribute(String)`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;`
- `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
- `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Replace `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`
- Change the type of `member` in the constructor to `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
- Replace `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)` with a method to retrieve the attribute from the member. Since `getStringAttribute` is removed, we need to find an alternative way to access the hostname.  After researching, it seems the hostname is no longer directly available as an attribute. We can use the `getAddress().getHost()` method instead of `getSocketAddress().getHostString()`. We can also use `member.getAddress().getHost()` to get the hostname.

e. Potential side effects:
- The change in import and type might affect other parts of the code that use `HazelcastClusterNodeInfo`. However, since the interface `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member` replaces the class `com.hazelcast.core.Member`, the impact should be minimal.
- The removal of `getStringAttribute` requires a different approach to retrieve the hostname. Using `member.getAddress().getHost()` should provide the correct hostname.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of the constructor is preserved.
- Variables can be created if needed.
- The `@Override` annotation is not present, so it doesn't need to be removed.
- The correct package is used for the import.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to:
1. Replace the import statement to use the new `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member` interface.
2. Update the constructor parameter type to `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
3. Replace `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)` with a method to retrieve the hostname from the member's address. `member.getAddress().getHost()` seems like the best alternative.
