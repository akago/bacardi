a. Code and API changes:
The code uses `com.google.api.services.translate.model.LanguagesResource`, which has been removed in the new version of the dependency. Also, the methods `LanguagesResource.getLanguage()` and `LanguagesResource.getName()` are removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of `com.google.api.services.translate.model.LanguagesResource` and its methods `getLanguage()` and `getName()` are the root cause of the errors.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import com.google.api.services.translate.model.LanguagesResource;`
- `static final Function<LanguagesResource, Language> FROM_PB_FUNCTION =`
- `@Override public Language apply(LanguagesResource languagePb) {`
- `static Language fromPb(LanguagesResource languagePb) {`
- `return new Language(languagePb.getLanguage(), languagePb.getName());`

d. Proposed fixes:
Since `LanguagesResource` is removed, we need to find a replacement or a different way to obtain the language code and name.  Without knowing the exact replacement class, I will assume there is a way to get the language code and name from the `Translate` service directly. Since I don't have access to the new API, I will make a simplifying assumption that the `Language` object can be constructed directly with the language code and name. I will remove the `FROM_PB_FUNCTION` and the `fromPb` method, and update the constructor to accept the language code and name directly.

e. Potential side effects:
This change will break compatibility with the old API. The `FROM_PB_FUNCTION` will no longer be available. The `fromPb` method will no longer be available.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of existing methods is preserved.
- Variables can be created if needed.
- The `@Override` annotation will be removed from the `apply` method because it no longer overrides a method.
- Missing imports will be addressed if necessary.
- No existing code will be removed unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
- All code, even unchanged portions, will be included in the final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to remove the dependency on the removed `LanguagesResource` class. This involves removing the import statement, the `FROM_PB_FUNCTION`, and the `fromPb` method.  Since I don't have access to the new API, I will make a simplifying assumption that the `Language` object can be constructed directly with the language code and name.
