The core issue is the removal of `com.google.api.services.translate.model.LanguagesResource` in the updated dependency. This class was used in the `Language` class for representing language information. The `getName()` and `getLanguage()` methods were also removed from this class.

Here's a breakdown of the affected code and potential fixes:

*   **Line 19: `import com.google.api.services.translate.model.LanguagesResource;`**
    *   This import statement is now invalid. We need to find a replacement class or a different way to represent language information. Since `LanguagesResource` is removed, we need to find an alternative. The new API uses `com.google.api.services.translate.v3.model.LanguageCode` and `com.google.api.services.translate.v3.Translate.Languages.List` to retrieve supported languages. However, we don't have access to the `Translate` object here. We can assume that the `code` and `name` are passed directly. Therefore, we can remove this import.
*   **Line 36: `static final Function<LanguagesResource, Language> FROM_PB_FUNCTION =`**
    *   `LanguagesResource` is no longer valid. We need to change the `Function` to accept a different input type or remove it entirely if it's no longer needed. Since `LanguagesResource` is removed, and we don't have a direct replacement, the best approach is to remove this `Function`. It's likely used to convert from the old `LanguagesResource` to the `Language` object, which is no longer necessary.
*   **Line 37: `new Function<LanguagesResource, Language>() {`**
    *   Related to the previous point, this needs to be removed.
*   **Line 39: `public Language apply(LanguagesResource languagePb) {`**
    *   Related to the previous points, this needs to be removed.
*   **Line 84: `static Language fromPb(LanguagesResource languagePb) {`**
    *   `LanguagesResource` is no longer valid. We need to change this method to accept the language code and name directly as strings. This aligns with the constructor of the `Language` class.

**Proposed Changes:**

1.  Remove the import statement: `import com.google.api.services.translate.model.LanguagesResource;`
2.  Remove the `FROM_PB_FUNCTION` field entirely.
3.  Modify the `fromPb` method to accept two `String` arguments (code and name) instead of `LanguagesResource`.

**Reasoning:**

The `LanguagesResource` class is no longer available, so we must adapt the code to work without it. The `FROM_PB_FUNCTION` is directly tied to this class, so it must be removed. The `fromPb` method is modified to accept the language code and name directly, which aligns with the constructor of the `Language` class and avoids the need for the removed `LanguagesResource`.

**Adherence to Constraints:**

1.  The function signature of existing methods (other than `fromPb`) is not changed.
2.  Variables are not created unnecessarily.
3.  The `@Override` annotation is removed from the `apply` method since it's being removed.
4.  The correct package/class is used (by removing the import).
5.  No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
6.  All code is included in the final output.
