a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code:
```java
import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;

@InterceptorBinding
```
- API Changes:
"Class javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding has been removed in the new version of the dependency."
"Interface jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding has been added in the new version of the dependency."

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The class `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` has been removed and replaced by the interface `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;`
- `@InterceptorBinding`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- Replace `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;` with `import jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;`
- Replace `@InterceptorBinding` with `@jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`

e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
The change should not have any side effects as it is simply replacing the old class with the new interface.

f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
1. The function signature of any method is not changed.
2. No variables are created.
3. The `@Override` annotation is not used.
4. The correct package is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
5. No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
6. All code is included in the final output.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
The best solution is to replace `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` with `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` in both the import statement and the annotation. This directly addresses the compilation errors caused by the API change and adheres to all the given constraints.
