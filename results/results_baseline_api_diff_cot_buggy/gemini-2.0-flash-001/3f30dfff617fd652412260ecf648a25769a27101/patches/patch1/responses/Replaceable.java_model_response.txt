a. Code and API changes:
The code uses `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`. The API changes indicate that `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` has been removed and `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` has been added.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` causes a compilation error because the code uses this class.

c. Affected lines of code:
- Line 5: `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;`
- Line 13: `@InterceptorBinding`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Replace `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` with `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` in both the import statement and the annotation.

e. Potential side effects:
- This change might require other adjustments if other parts of the code rely on the specific behavior of the old `javax.interceptor` package. However, based on the provided information, this should be the only necessary change.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature is not changed.
- No methods are added or removed.
- The `@Override` annotation is not used in this code.
- The correct package is used for the import.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` with `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` in both the import statement and the annotation. This directly addresses the compilation error caused by the API change and adheres to all the given constraints.
