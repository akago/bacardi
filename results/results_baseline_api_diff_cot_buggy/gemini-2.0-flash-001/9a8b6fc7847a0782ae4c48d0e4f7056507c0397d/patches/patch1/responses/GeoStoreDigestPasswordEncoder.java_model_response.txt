<fix_planning>
a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- The code uses `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder`.
- The API changes indicate that `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` has been removed.
- The methods `PasswordEncoder.setPasswordEncryptor()` and the constructor `PasswordEncoder()` have also been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` class and its constructor.
- The removal of the `setPasswordEncryptor` method.

c. Affected lines of code:
- Line 24: `import org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder;`
- Line 44: `protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder()`
- Line 45: `PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();`
- Line 46: `encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- Line 24: Remove the import statement. Since the class is removed, the import is no longer needed.
- Line 44: Since `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` is removed, we need to find a replacement.  Since the method returns a `PasswordEncoder`, we need to find a suitable replacement that implements the same interface or a compatible one.  Since the `PasswordEncoder` is used to encrypt passwords using `StrongPasswordEncryptor`, we can replace it with a custom implementation that uses `StrongPasswordEncryptor` directly. We can create a simple class that implements `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder` and uses `StrongPasswordEncryptor` internally.
- Line 45: Replace `PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();` with an instantiation of the custom `PasswordEncoder` implementation.
- Line 46: Remove this line, as the `setPasswordEncryptor` method no longer exists.

e. Potential side effects of the proposed changes:
- The code will no longer use the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder`. This might affect the way passwords are encrypted and validated if other parts of the application rely on the specific behavior of the removed class. We need to ensure that the custom implementation provides equivalent functionality.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of `createStringEncoder` is preserved.
- A new variable (the custom `PasswordEncoder` implementation) is created.
- The `@Override` annotation might need to be removed if the method no longer overrides a method in a parent class.
- Missing imports are addressed by removing the unnecessary import and potentially adding a new one for the custom implementation.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix:
The best solution is to remove the import statement for `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder`, create a custom implementation of `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder` that uses `StrongPasswordEncryptor` directly, instantiate this custom implementation in `createStringEncoder`, and remove the call to `setPasswordEncryptor`. This approach addresses the API changes while preserving the original functionality of the code.
