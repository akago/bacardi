a. Code and API changes:
The code uses `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(...)`.
The API changes indicate that `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getInstance()` has been removed, and `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getExecutor(java.lang.String,liquibase.database.Database)` has been added. Also, the interface `liquibase.executor.Executor` has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of `ExecutorService.getInstance()` is the direct cause of the compilation error.

c. Affected lines of code:
```java
ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));
```

d. Proposed fixes:
Since `ExecutorService.getInstance()` is removed, we need to find a way to get an `Executor` instance. The API changes suggest a new `getExecutor` method in `ExecutorService` that takes a database object. However, `ExecutorService` itself is removed. We need to find where the `ExecutorService` is now located and how to get an `Executor` instance.

Looking at the Liquibase documentation and examples, it seems the `Database` object itself now has the `executor` and we can get it directly from the database object.

Therefore, the proposed fix is to replace `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this)` with `getExecutor()`.

e. Potential side effects:
This change assumes that the `getExecutor()` method is now directly available in the `Database` class (or a parent class) and returns an object that has an `execute` method. This seems to be the intended usage based on the API changes.

f. Adherence to constraints:
1. The function signature of `dropDatabaseObjects` is not changed.
2. A variable is not needed.
3. The `@Override` annotation is kept as the method still overrides a method in the parent class.
4. No new imports are needed.
5. No existing code is removed except for the call to the removed `getInstance()` method.
6. All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this)` with `getExecutor()`. This directly addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of `ExecutorService.getInstance()` and aligns with the new API usage pattern where the `Database` object provides direct access to the `Executor`.
