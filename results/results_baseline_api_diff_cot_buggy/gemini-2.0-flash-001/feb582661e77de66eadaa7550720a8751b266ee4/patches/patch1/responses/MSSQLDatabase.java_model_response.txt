a. Code and API changes:
The failing line is:
```java
ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));
```
The error message is "cannot find symbol method getInstance() location: class liquibase.executor.ExecutorService".
The API changes indicate that "Method liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getInstance() has been removed in the new version of the dependency." and "Method liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getExecutor(java.lang.String,liquibase.database.Database) has been added in the new version of the dependency." Also, the interface `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService` has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getInstance()` is the direct cause of the compilation error. The new `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getExecutor(java.lang.String,liquibase.database.Database)` method suggests a different way to obtain an executor. Since the `ExecutorService` interface is also removed, we can no longer call static methods on it.

c. Affected lines of code:
The line `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));` is affected.

d. Proposed fixes:
Since `ExecutorService.getInstance()` is removed, we need to find an alternative way to get an executor. The new `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getExecutor(java.lang.String,liquibase.database.Database)` method might be the solution. However, since the `ExecutorService` interface is removed, we can't call `getExecutor` on the class directly. We need to find where the `getExecutor` method is now located and how to access it.

Looking at the Liquibase codebase, it appears that `ExecutorService` is now a class and the `getExecutor` method is intended to be called statically, but it requires a database id. We can try to use the database id to get the executor.

The proposed fix is to use `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getExecutor(this.getDatabaseChangeLogLockId(), this)` instead of `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this)`.

e. Potential side effects:
The change in how the executor is obtained might have subtle side effects if the new method uses a different configuration or initialization process. However, since we are only changing how the executor is obtained and not how it's used, the risk should be minimal.

f. Adherence to constraints:
The proposed change adheres to all constraints:
- The function signature of `dropDatabaseObjects` is not changed.
- A variable is not created.
- The `@Override` annotation is kept as the method still overrides a method in the parent class.
- No code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
- All code, even unchanged portions, are included in the final output.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to replace `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this)` with `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService.getExecutor(this.getDatabaseChangeLogLockId(), this)`. This addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of `ExecutorService.getInstance()` and uses the new `getExecutor` method with the database id.
