The problem is that several classes from `redis.clients.jedis.commands` have been removed in the newer version of the Jedis library. Specifically, `BasicRedisPipeline`, `ScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `BinaryRedisPipeline`, `BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `ClusterPipeline`, `MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline`, `RedisPipeline`, and `MultiKeyCommandsPipeline` are no longer available.

The `RedisGraphPipeline` interface extends all these removed interfaces, causing compilation errors. The fix involves removing these interfaces from the `extends` clause of the `RedisGraphPipeline` interface. Since `ClusterPipeline` is now an interface instead of a class, we should keep it.

Here's a breakdown of the affected lines and proposed fixes:

*   **Lines 3-10, 21-24**: These lines import the removed classes. These import statements should be removed.
*   **Line 16**: `public interface RedisGraphPipeline extends MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline, MultiKeyCommandsPipeline, ClusterPipeline, BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline, ScriptingCommandsPipeline, BasicRedisPipeline, BinaryRedisPipeline, RedisPipeline, Closeable {`
    This line needs to be modified to remove the references to the deleted interfaces. The corrected line should be: `public interface RedisGraphPipeline extends ClusterPipeline, Closeable {`

The proposed changes adhere to all constraints:

*   No function signatures are changed.
*   No methods are added or removed.
*   Only the `extends` clause of the interface is modified to remove non-existent interfaces.
*   No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
*   All code, including unchanged portions, will be included in the final output.

Final summary:

The best solution is to remove the references to the non-existent interfaces (`BasicRedisPipeline`, `ScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `BinaryRedisPipeline`, `BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline`, `RedisPipeline`, and `MultiKeyCommandsPipeline`) from the `extends` clause of the `RedisGraphPipeline` interface and remove the corresponding import statements. This resolves the compilation errors caused by the API changes in the Jedis library.
