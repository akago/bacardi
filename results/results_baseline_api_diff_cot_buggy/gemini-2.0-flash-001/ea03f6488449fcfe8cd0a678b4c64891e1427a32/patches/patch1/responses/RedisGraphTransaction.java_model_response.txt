The problem is that several `redis.clients.jedis.commands` interfaces used in `RedisGraphTransaction` are no longer available in the updated Jedis dependency. Specifically, `RedisPipeline`, `BinaryRedisPipeline`, `BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline`, `ScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `MultiKeyCommandsPipeline`, `BasicRedisPipeline`, and `ClusterPipeline` have been removed.

The affected lines are the `implements` clause of the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface:

```java
public interface RedisGraphTransaction extends
        MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline,
        MultiKeyCommandsPipeline, ClusterPipeline,
        BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline, ScriptingCommandsPipeline,
        BasicRedisPipeline, BinaryRedisPipeline, RedisPipeline, Closeable {
```

Since these interfaces are no longer available, the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface can no longer implement them. The simplest solution is to remove these interfaces from the `implements` clause. This will likely break the contract of the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface, as classes implementing it will no longer be required to implement the methods defined in the removed interfaces. However, given the constraints, this is the only viable option.

The proposed change adheres to all constraints:
1.  The function signatures of existing methods are not changed.
2.  No variables are created.
3.  The `@Override` annotation is not used, so there is no need to remove it.
4.  No imports are added or removed (except for the removal of the now unused imports).
5.  No existing code is removed, except for the interfaces in the `implements` clause.
6.  The complete, fixed Java class is output.

Final summary:
The best solution is to remove the unavailable interfaces from the `implements` clause of the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface. This is the only way to resolve the compilation errors caused by the breaking API changes while adhering to the given constraints.
