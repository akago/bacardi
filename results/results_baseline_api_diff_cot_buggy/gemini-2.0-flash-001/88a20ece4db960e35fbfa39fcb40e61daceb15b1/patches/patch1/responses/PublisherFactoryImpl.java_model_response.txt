a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata`, which has been removed.
- The code uses `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.wire.PartitionPublisherFactory`, which has been removed.
- The code uses `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.wire.SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder.setContext`, which has been removed.
- The code uses `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.TopicPath.Builder`, which has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- Removal of `PublishMetadata` makes the generic type `Publisher<PublishMetadata>` invalid.
- Removal of `PartitionPublisherFactory` makes the lambda expression incompatible with the expected type.
- Removal of `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder.setContext` causes a compilation error.
- Removal of `TopicPath.Builder` means we need to find another way to construct `TopicPath`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
- `public Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params)`
- `builder.setPublisherFactory(...)`
- `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder.newBuilder().setContext(PubsubContext.of(FRAMEWORK))`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Remove `PublishMetadata` import and change `Publisher<PublishMetadata>` to `Publisher<Void>` since `PublishMetadata` is no longer available. `Void` is a suitable replacement as it indicates the publisher doesn't need to return any metadata.
- Replace the lambda expression for `setPublisherFactory` with a suitable alternative that doesn't rely on the removed `PartitionPublisherFactory`. The new version of the library likely has a different way to create publishers for each partition.  Since `PartitionPublisherFactory` is removed, we need to find a way to create a `Publisher` directly.  The `RoutingPublisherBuilder` likely has a different way to add partition publishers.  After reviewing the available methods, it seems the correct approach is to use `setPublisherFactory` with a `Function<Long, Publisher<Void>>`.
- Remove `setContext` from `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder`.

e. Potential side effects:
- Changing `Publisher<PublishMetadata>` to `Publisher<Void>` might affect how the publisher is used elsewhere, but since we are only modifying the client code, we assume the rest of the application can handle a `Publisher<Void>`.
- Removing `setContext` might change the behavior of the publisher, but we assume the default context is sufficient or that the context is now handled differently.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- We are not changing the function signature (except for the generic type, which is necessary).
- We are creating variables.
- We are removing the `@Override` annotation if necessary.
- We are addressing missing imports.
- We are not removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation error.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to:
1. Remove the import for `PublishMetadata`.
2. Change the return type of `newPublisher` to `Publisher<Void>`.
3. Replace the lambda expression for `setPublisherFactory` with a `Function<Long, Publisher<Void>>`.
4. Remove the `setContext` call from `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder`.
These changes address the compilation errors caused by the API changes while adhering to the given constraints.
