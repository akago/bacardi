The error message indicates that `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` has been removed in the new version of the dependency. The code uses `PublishMetadata` in the `PublisherFactory` interface.

The affected lines are:
- `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
- `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`

Since `PublishMetadata` is removed, we need to find a suitable replacement or remove its usage. Looking at the `com.google.cloud.pubsublite` package, there doesn't seem to be a direct replacement for `PublishMetadata`. Since the interface defines a `Publisher` of `PublishMetadata`, we need to understand what the `Publisher` is used for. Without more context, the best approach is to replace `PublishMetadata` with `byte[]`, which is a common type for message payloads. This assumes that the publisher now deals with raw byte arrays instead of structured metadata.

The proposed changes are:
1. Remove the import statement: `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
2. Modify the `newPublisher` method signature to use `byte[]`: `Publisher<byte[]> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`

These changes adhere to the constraints:
1. The function signature of `newPublisher` is technically changed, but the interface definition is allowed to be changed.
2. No variables are created.
3. The `@Override` annotation is not present, so it doesn't need to be removed.
4. The import statement is removed because the class is no longer used.
5. No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
6. All code is included in the final output.

Final summary:
The best solution is to replace `PublishMetadata` with `byte[]` in the `PublisherFactory` interface. This addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of `PublishMetadata` and allows the code to compile with the updated dependency.
