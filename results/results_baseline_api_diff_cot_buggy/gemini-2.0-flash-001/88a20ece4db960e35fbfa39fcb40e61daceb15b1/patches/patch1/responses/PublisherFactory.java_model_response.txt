a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata`.
- The error message indicates that `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- Removal of `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
- `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Remove the import statement `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`.
- Replace `PublishMetadata` with `byte[]` in the `newPublisher` method signature. This assumes that the publisher now deals with raw byte arrays instead of a specific metadata class.

e. Potential side effects:
- The change in the method signature of `newPublisher` might require changes in the classes that implement this interface.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of `newPublisher` is being changed, but the problem description allows this.
- No code is being removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to remove the import statement for `PublishMetadata` and replace `PublishMetadata` with `byte[]` in the `newPublisher` method signature. This addresses the compilation errors caused by the removal of the `PublishMetadata` class in the updated dependency.
