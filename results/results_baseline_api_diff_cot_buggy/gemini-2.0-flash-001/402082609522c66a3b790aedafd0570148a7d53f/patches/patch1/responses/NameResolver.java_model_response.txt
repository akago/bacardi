a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource`.
- The API changes indicate that `org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource` has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of `org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource` is the direct cause of the compilation errors.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `private final CommandSource invoker;`
- `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;`
- `public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, String targetName, Player receiver`

d. Proposed fixes:
Since `CommandSource` has been removed, we need to find a suitable replacement. Looking at the Sponge API, `CommandSource` was often used for anything that could execute a command. A common replacement is `org.spongepowered.api.service.context.ContextSource`. However, without more context on how `invoker` is used, it's difficult to determine the best replacement. Since we don't have enough information to determine the correct replacement, and we are constrained to not change the functionality, the best course of action is to replace `CommandSource` with `Object`. This will allow the code to compile, but may cause runtime errors if the code relies on specific functionality of `CommandSource`.

- `private final CommandSource invoker;` -> `private final Object invoker;`
- `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;` -> Remove this line.
- `public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, String targetName, Player receiver` -> `public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, Object invoker, String targetName, Player receiver`

e. Potential side effects:
- Replacing `CommandSource` with `Object` might lead to runtime errors if the code relies on specific methods or properties of the `CommandSource` interface.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signature of the constructor is changed, violating constraint 1. To avoid this, we can overload the constructor.
- The proposed changes adhere to the other constraints.

g. Final summary:
The best solution is to replace `CommandSource` with `Object` and overload the constructor to maintain backward compatibility. This allows the code to compile while minimizing changes.
