a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code:
```java
import javax.mvc.Controller;
import javax.mvc.Models;
import javax.mvc.MvcContext;

@Controller
Models models;
MvcContext mvc;
```
- API Changes:
  - `Class javax.mvc.Controller has been removed` and `Interface jakarta.mvc.Controller has been added`.
  - `Interface jakarta.mvc.Models has been added` and `Class javax.mvc.Models has been removed`.
  - `Class javax.mvc.MvcContext has been removed`.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The classes `javax.mvc.Controller`, `javax.mvc.Models`, and `javax.mvc.MvcContext` have been removed and replaced with `jakarta.mvc.Controller`, `jakarta.mvc.Models` and a replacement for `MvcContext` which is not explicitly mentioned.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import javax.mvc.Controller;`
- `@Controller`
- `import javax.mvc.Models;`
- `Models models;`
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`
- `MvcContext mvc;`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- `import javax.mvc.Controller;`: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.Controller;`
- `@Controller`: Replace with `@jakarta.mvc.Controller`
- `import javax.mvc.Models;`: Replace with `import jakarta.mvc.Models;`
- `Models models;`: Replace with `jakarta.mvc.Models models;`
- `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`: Remove this line.  We will need to find an alternative to `MvcContext`. After researching, it seems `UriInfo` can be used to get the locale.
- `MvcContext mvc;`: Remove this line and inject `javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo uriInfo;` and use `uriInfo.getRequest().getLocale()` instead of `mvc.getLocale()`.

e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
- The change from `javax.mvc` to `jakarta.mvc` should not have any side effects as it is a direct replacement.
- Replacing `MvcContext` with `UriInfo` might have side effects if other functionalities of `MvcContext` were used. However, in this specific case, only `getLocale()` is used, which can be replaced by `uriInfo.getRequest().getLocale()`.

f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
1. Do not change the function signature of any method: The signature of `get()` remains unchanged.
2. You may create variables if it simplifies the code: We are creating `uriInfo`.
3. Remove the @Override annotation if and only if the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version: Not applicable here.
4. If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version: We are using `jakarta.mvc` and `javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo`.
5. Do not remove any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error: We are only removing the import and field related to `MvcContext` because they cause compilation errors.
6. Include all code, even unchanged portions, in your final output: The complete class is included.
7. Do not use placeholder comments like "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)": No placeholder comments are used.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
The best solution is to replace the `javax.mvc` imports and annotations with their `jakarta.mvc` counterparts, remove the `MvcContext` related code, and use `UriInfo` to get the locale. This addresses the compilation errors caused by the API changes and maintains the functionality of the code.
