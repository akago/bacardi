a. Relevant code:
```java
import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;

public final class TaxBeneficiaries extends IterableEnvelope<Remote> {

    public TaxBeneficiaries(final Iterable<Remote> nodes) {
        super(() -> new Sorted<>(
            Comparator.comparing(Remote::score),
            new Filtered<>(
                n -> new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue() >= 16,
                nodes
            )
        ));
    }
}
```

Relevant API changes:
- `Class org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`
- `Type reference org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf(java.lang.Iterable) has been added in the new version of the dependency.`

b. The class `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed. The code uses `new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes())`. The `score().suffixes()` method returns an `Iterable`. The new `LengthOf` expects an `Input` or `Text` or `Iterable`. We need to find a replacement for `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` that accepts an `Iterable`. The new `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` can be used with an Iterable.

c. Affected line:
```java
n -> new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue() >= 16,
```

d. Potential fixes:
1. Replace `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`. This requires changing the import statement and using `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`.
2. Use `org.cactoos.collection.LengthOf` instead.
3. Use `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` and call `value()` instead of `intValue()`.

e. Side effects:
1. Using `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` might require a change in the import statement and using `value()` instead of `intValue()`.
2. Using `org.cactoos.collection.LengthOf` might require a change in the import statement and using `value()` instead of `intValue()`.

f. Constraints:
1. Do not change the function signature of any method. - The proposed changes do not violate this constraint.
2. You may create variables if it simplifies the code. - The proposed changes do not violate this constraint.
3. Remove the @Override annotation if and only if the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version. - The proposed changes do not violate this constraint.
4. If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version. - The proposed changes adhere to this constraint.
5. Do not remove any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. - The proposed changes adhere to this constraint.
6. Include all code, even unchanged portions, in your final output. - The proposed changes adhere to this constraint.
7. Do not use placeholder comments like "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)". - The proposed changes adhere to this constraint.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` and use `value()` instead of `intValue()`. This aligns with the updated API and resolves the compilation error.
