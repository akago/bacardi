a. Code and API changes:
- Code: `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;` and `new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()` and `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue()`
- API Changes: `Class org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Type reference org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf(java.lang.Iterable) has been added in the new version of the dependency.`

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The class `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed. The new version provides `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` which takes an Iterable as input.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;`
- `return new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()`
- `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue()`

d. Proposed fixes:
1. Replace `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`. This requires changing the import statement and the constructor call.
2. Since `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` is a scalar, we need to call `value()` instead of `intValue()`.
3. Add import `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`

e. Potential side effects:
The change should not have any side effects as we are only replacing a deprecated class with its replacement.

f. Adherence to constraints:
1. The function signature of the method `compareTo` is not changed.
2. We are creating new import statement.
3. We are removing the old import statement.
4. We are not removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
5. We are including all code in our final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` and call `value()` instead of `intValue()`. This fixes the compilation error and adheres to all the constraints.
