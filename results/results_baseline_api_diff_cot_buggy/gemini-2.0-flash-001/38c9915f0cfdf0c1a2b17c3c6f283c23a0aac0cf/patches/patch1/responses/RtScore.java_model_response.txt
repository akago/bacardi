a. Code and API changes:
- Code: `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;` and `new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()` and `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue()`
- API Changes: `Class org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Type reference org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf(java.lang.Iterable) has been added in the new version of the dependency.`

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The class `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed, and `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` has been added, which takes an Iterable as an argument.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;`
- `return new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()`
- ` - new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue();`

d. Proposed fixes:
- Replace `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;` with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`
- Replace `new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()` with `new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).value()`
- Replace `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue()` with `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).value()`

e. Potential side effects:
The return type of `LengthOf.value()` might be different from `LengthOf.intValue()`. However, in this case, it returns an `int`, so there should be no side effects.

f. Adherence to constraints:
1. The function signature of `compareTo` is not changed.
2. No variables are created.
3. The `@Override` annotation is kept as the method still overrides a method in the interface.
4. The correct package `org.cactoos.scalar` is used.
5. No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
6. All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace the import statement and use the new `LengthOf` class from `org.cactoos.scalar` and call the `value()` method instead of `intValue()`. This fixes the compilation error and maintains the original functionality.
