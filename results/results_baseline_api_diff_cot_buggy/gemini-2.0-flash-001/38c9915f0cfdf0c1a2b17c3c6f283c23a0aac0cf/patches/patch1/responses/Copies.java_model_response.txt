a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code: `import org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf;` and `new CollectionOf<>(first.ledger()).size()` and `new CollectionOf<>(second.ledger()).size()`
- API Changes: `Class org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf has been removed in the new version of the dependency.` and `Constructor org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf(java.lang.Iterable) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The class `org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf` has been removed, so the import statement is invalid and the constructor call `new CollectionOf<>(...)` is also invalid.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf;`
- `).size() == new CollectionOf<>(second.ledger()).size();`
- `).size() == new CollectionOf<>(first.ledger()).size();`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- Remove the import statement `import org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf;`
- Replace `new CollectionOf<>(first.ledger()).size()` with `java.util.stream.StreamSupport.stream(first.ledger().spliterator(), false).count()`
- Replace `new CollectionOf<>(second.ledger()).size()` with `java.util.stream.StreamSupport.stream(second.ledger().spliterator(), false).count()`

e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
The change from `CollectionOf` to `java.util.stream.StreamSupport.stream(...).count()` might have a performance impact, but it should be functionally equivalent.

f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
1. Do not change the function signature of any method: The signatures are unchanged.
2. You may create variables if it simplifies the code: No new variables are created.
3. Remove the @Override annotation if and only if the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version: The `@Override` annotation is not present in the code.
4. If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version: The import statement is removed, and `java.util.stream.StreamSupport` is used which is part of the standard Java library.
5. Do not remove any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error: Only the import statement and the `CollectionOf` usages are removed.
6. Include all code, even unchanged portions, in your final output: All code is included.
7. Do not use placeholder comments like "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)": No placeholder comments are used.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
The best solution is to remove the import statement for `org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf` and replace the usages of `new CollectionOf<>(...).size()` with `java.util.stream.StreamSupport.stream(...).count()`. This resolves the compilation error caused by the missing class and maintains the original functionality of counting the number of elements in the iterable.
