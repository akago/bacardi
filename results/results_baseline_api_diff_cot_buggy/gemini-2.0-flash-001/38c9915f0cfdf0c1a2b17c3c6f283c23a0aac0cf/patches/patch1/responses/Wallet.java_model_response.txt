The errors indicate that the classes `SplitText`, `CheckedScalar`, `Filtered`, and `UncheckedScalar` from the `org.cactoos` library are no longer available in the updated version. We need to find alternative ways to achieve the same functionality using the updated library or standard Java libraries.

1.  **`SplitText`**: This class was used to split a text into a list of strings based on a delimiter. Since `SplitText` is removed, we can use standard Java's `String.split()` method in conjunction with `java.util.Arrays.asList()` and `org.cactoos.list.ListOf` to achieve the same result.

    *   Affected line: `import org.cactoos.text.SplitText;`
    *   Affected code:
        ```java
        new ListOf<>(
            new SplitText(
                new TextOf(this.path),
                "\n"
            )
        ).get(2).asString()
        ```
    *   Proposed fix: Replace the `SplitText` usage with `java.nio.file.Files.readAllLines(this.path).get(2)` after converting the path to a `java.io.File` object. This reads all lines from the file into a list, and then we can access the desired line by index.
    *   Side effects: This approach reads the entire file into memory, which might be inefficient for very large files. However, given the context of wallet files, this is unlikely to be a major concern.
    *   Adherence to constraints: This change does not alter any function signatures. It replaces the usage of a removed class with standard Java library calls.

2.  **`CheckedScalar`**: This class was used to wrap a scalar and throw a checked exception if an error occurred during its evaluation. Since `CheckedScalar` is removed, we can use a try-catch block to handle the potential `IOException` during the parsing of the wallet ID.

    *   Affected line: `import org.cactoos.scalar.CheckedScalar;`
    *   Affected code:
        ```java
        new CheckedScalar<>(
            () -> Long.parseUnsignedLong(
                new ListOf<>(
                    new SplitText(
                        new TextOf(this.path),
                        "\n"
                    )
                ).get(2).asString(),
                // @checkstyle MagicNumber (1 line)
                16
            ),
            e -> new IOException(e)
        ).value();
        ```
    *   Proposed fix: Replace the `CheckedScalar` with a try-catch block. The code inside the `CheckedScalar` will be placed inside the `try` block, and any `Exception` will be caught and re-thrown as an `IOException`.
    *   Side effects: None.
    *   Adherence to constraints: This change does not alter any function signatures. It replaces the usage of a removed class with a standard try-catch block.

3.  **`Filtered`**: This class was used to filter an iterable based on a predicate. The new version of `cactoos` provides `org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered` with a different constructor.

    *   Affected line: `import org.cactoos.collection.Filtered;`
    *   Affected code:
        ```java
        final Iterable<Transaction> candidates = new Filtered<>(
            incoming -> new Filtered<>(
                origin -> new UncheckedScalar<>(
                    new Or(
                        () -> incoming.equals(origin),
                        () -> incoming.id() == origin.id()
                            && incoming.bnf().equals(origin.bnf()),
                        () -> incoming.id() == origin.id()
                            && incoming.amount() < 0L,
                        () -> incoming.prefix().equals(origin.prefix())
                    )
                ).value(),
                ledger
            ).isEmpty(),
            other.ledger()
        );
        ```
    *   Proposed fix: Replace `org.cactoos.collection.Filtered` with `org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered`. Also, since `UncheckedScalar` is removed, we need to handle the exception within the lambda expression.
    *   Side effects: None.
    *   Adherence to constraints: This change does not alter any function signatures. It replaces the usage of a removed class with its replacement and handles the exception within the lambda.

4.  **`UncheckedScalar`**: This class was used to wrap a scalar and avoid checked exceptions. Since `UncheckedScalar` is removed, we can use a try-catch block to handle the potential exceptions during the evaluation of the scalar.

    *   Affected line: `import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;`
    *   Affected code:
        ```java
        new UncheckedScalar<>(
            new Or(
                () -> incoming.equals(origin),
                () -> incoming.id() == origin.id()
                    && incoming.bnf().equals(origin.bnf()),
                () -> incoming.id() == origin.id()
                    && incoming.amount() < 0L,
                () -> incoming.prefix().equals(origin.prefix())
            )
        ).value()
        ```
    *   Proposed fix: Replace the `UncheckedScalar` with a try-catch block within the lambda expression used in the `Filtered` constructor.
    *   Side effects: None.
    *   Adherence to constraints: This change does not alter any function signatures. It replaces the usage of a removed class with a standard try-catch block.

Final summary:
The best solution is to replace the removed `cactoos` classes with their alternatives or standard Java equivalents. This approach ensures that the code continues to function as intended while adhering to the constraints. Specifically, `SplitText` is replaced with `java.nio.file.Files.readAllLines()`, `CheckedScalar` and `UncheckedScalar` are replaced with try-catch blocks, and `org.cactoos.collection.Filtered` is replaced with `org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered`.
