a. Relevant code:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;

public interface Remote {
    ...
    public Fake(final int val) {
        this(new RtScore(
            new Repeated<>(val, new RandomText())
        ));
    }
    ...
}
```
API changes:
`Class org.cactoos.text.RandomText has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`

b. The `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` class has been removed, causing a compilation error.

c. Affected line:
```java
new Repeated<>(val, new RandomText())
```

d. Potential fixes:
Since `RandomText` is removed, we need to find a replacement.  `org.cactoos.text.TextOf` combined with `org.cactoos.scalar.Unchecked` and `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` can be used to generate random text.

e. Side effects:
The change will replace the old `RandomText` with a new implementation using `TextOf` and `UUID.randomUUID()`. This might have subtle differences in the generated random text, but should not affect the overall functionality.

f. Constraints:
The proposed change adheres to all constraints:
- No function signatures are changed.
- Variables can be created if needed.
- `@Override` annotations are not affected.
- No code is removed unless it directly causes an error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace `new RandomText()` with `new TextOf(new Unchecked<>(UUID::randomUUID).value().toString())`. This uses the `TextOf` class to create a text from a random UUID, effectively replacing the functionality of the removed `RandomText` class.
