a. Code and API changes:
- The code uses `org.cactoos.text.RandomText`.
- The error message indicates that `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` cannot be found.
- The API changes confirm that the class `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
- The removal of the class `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` is the direct cause of the compilation error.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;`
- The constructor `new Repeated<>(val, new RandomText())` inside the `Fake` class constructor.

d. Proposed fixes:
- Remove the import statement `import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;`.
- Replace `new RandomText()` with a suitable alternative. Since `RandomText` is no longer available, we can use `new org.cactoos.text.TextOf(UUID.randomUUID().toString())` as a replacement. This will generate a random string. We need to import `java.util.UUID`.

e. Potential side effects:
- The change from `RandomText` to `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` might affect the randomness or format of the generated text. However, since this is a `Fake` implementation for testing purposes, the exact format is likely not critical.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signatures are not changed.
- A variable is not created.
- The `@Override` annotation is not removed.
- The correct package is used for the new import.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace the usage of the removed `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` class with `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` and add the corresponding import statement. This addresses the compilation error while maintaining the functionality of generating a random string within the `Fake` implementation.
