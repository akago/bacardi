a. Code and API changes:
The code uses `org.cactoos.text.RandomText`. The API changes indicate that `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` has been removed.

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of the class `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` is the direct cause of the compilation error.

c. Affected lines of code:
- `import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;`
- The constructor `public Fake(final int val)` which uses `new RandomText()`

d. Proposed fixes:
1. Replace `RandomText` with an alternative that provides similar functionality. `org.cactoos.text.TextOf` in combination with `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` can be used to generate random text.
2. Remove the import statement `import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;`

e. Potential side effects:
The replacement might slightly alter the behavior of the `Fake` class, but since it's a fake implementation, this is acceptable as long as it still provides random text.

f. Adherence to constraints:
- The function signatures of all methods remain unchanged.
- The `@Override` annotations are kept since the methods still override interface methods.
- No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
- All code, even unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

g. Summary:
The best solution is to replace `RandomText` with `TextOf(UUID.randomUUID().toString())` to generate random text and remove the import statement. This addresses the compilation error caused by the removal of `RandomText` while maintaining the functionality of the `Fake` class.
