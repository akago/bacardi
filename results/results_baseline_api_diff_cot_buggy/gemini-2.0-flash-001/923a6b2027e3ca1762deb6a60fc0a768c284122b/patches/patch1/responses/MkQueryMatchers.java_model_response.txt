a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
- Code: `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`
- Code: `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawPath", path)`
- Code: `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawQuery", query)`
- API Change: `Class org.hamcrest.Matchers has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`
- API Change: `Constructor org.hamcrest.Matchers() has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`

b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
The removal of the `org.hamcrest.Matchers` class is the root cause. The code relies on static methods within this class, specifically `hasProperty`.

c. Affected lines of code:
- Line 34: `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`
- Line 60: `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawPath", path)`
- Line 69: `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawQuery", query)`

d. Proposed potential fixes for each affected line:
- Line 34: Remove the import statement.
- Line 60: Replace `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawPath", path)` with `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.<URI>hasProperty("rawPath", path)`. This uses the `HasPropertyWithValue` class from `org.hamcrest.beans` which provides the `hasProperty` method.
- Line 69: Replace `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawQuery", query)` with `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.<URI>hasProperty("rawQuery", query)`. This uses the `HasPropertyWithValue` class from `org.hamcrest.beans` which provides the `hasProperty` method.
- Add import statement: `import org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue;`

e. Potential side effects of the proposed changes:
The change replaces the usage of `org.hamcrest.Matchers.hasProperty` with `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.hasProperty`. This assumes that the functionality of `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.hasProperty` is equivalent to the original usage.  It's crucial to ensure that the behavior remains consistent.

f. Adherence to constraints:
1. No function signatures are changed.
2. A new import statement is added.
3. No `@Override` annotations are present.
4. The correct package (`org.hamcrest.beans`) is used for the replacement class.
5. No code is removed unnecessarily.
6. All code is included in the final output.

g. Final summary of the chosen fix:
The best solution is to replace the deprecated `org.hamcrest.Matchers.hasProperty` with `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.hasProperty`. This involves removing the import for `org.hamcrest.Matchers`, adding an import for `org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue`, and updating the calls to `hasProperty` accordingly. This approach addresses the compilation error caused by the API change while preserving the intended functionality.
