1. **Analyze the problem and propose changes:**
   a. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
      - The code uses `javax.mvc.MvcContext` which has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
      - The error occurs in the line `private MvcContext mvcContext;` because the class `MvcContext` is no longer available.
   
   b. **Identify the specific API changes causing the issue:**
      - The class `javax.mvc.MvcContext` has been removed, which is directly used in the code.

   c. **List the affected lines of code:**
      - `private MvcContext mvcContext;`
      - `@Inject private MvcContext mvcContext;`
      - `final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, mvcContext.getLocale());`

   d. **Propose potential fixes for each affected line:**
      - Replace `MvcContext` with a similar class or interface that provides the same functionality, such as `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` if it exists in the new version.
      - Alternatively, use `Locale` directly if the locale can be obtained from another context or injected directly.

   e. **Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:**
      - If `MvcContext` is replaced with a different class, ensure that the new class provides the `getLocale()` method.
      - If `Locale` is used directly, ensure that the locale is correctly obtained from the request context.

   f. **Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:**
      - The function signatures remain unchanged.
      - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
      - The fix only modifies the client code.

   g. **Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:**
      - The best solution is to replace `javax.mvc.MvcContext` with `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` if it exists in the new version, as it is the most straightforward replacement that maintains the same functionality.

2. **Apply the fix to the Java code:**
   - Replace `javax.mvc.MvcContext` with `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext`.
   - Update the import statement accordingly.
