1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The error messages indicate that the classes `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` are no longer available.
   - The API changes show that these classes have been removed and replaced with their `jakarta.mvc` counterparts.
   - The method `getUriInfo()` has been moved to the `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` class.

2. **Affected Lines of Code:**
   - `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver;`
   - `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext;`
   - `public class QueryParamLocaleResolver implements LocaleResolver {`
   - `public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context) {`

3. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver`.
   - Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext`.
   - The method `resolveLocale` should still work as expected since the method signature remains the same, and the `getUriInfo()` method is now available in the `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` class.

4. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The change in package names might affect other parts of the codebase that depend on these classes. However, since we are only modifying the imports and the class implementations, the impact should be minimal.

5. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signature of `resolveLocale` remains unchanged.
   - No variables are created, as it is not necessary.
   - The `@Override` annotation is retained because the method still overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
   - The correct package and class are used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
   - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
   - All code, including unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

6. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to update the imports to use the `jakarta.mvc` package instead of `javax.mvc`. This change aligns with the updated dependency and resolves the compilation errors without altering the functionality of the code.
