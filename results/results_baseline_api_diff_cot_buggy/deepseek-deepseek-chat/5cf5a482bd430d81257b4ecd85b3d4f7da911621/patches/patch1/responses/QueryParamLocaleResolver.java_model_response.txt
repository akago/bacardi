1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The errors indicate that the classes `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` are no longer available in the new version of the dependency.
   - The API changes show that these classes have been moved to the `jakarta.mvc.locale` package.
   - The affected lines are:
     - `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver;`
     - `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext;`
     - `public class QueryParamLocaleResolver implements LocaleResolver {`
     - `public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context) {`

2. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Update the imports to use the `jakarta.mvc.locale` package instead of `javax.mvc.locale`.
   - The method signature `public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context)` should remain unchanged as per the constraints.
   - The `@Override` annotation should be retained since the method still overrides a method in the updated dependency version.

3. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The change in package names might affect other parts of the codebase that depend on these classes. However, since we are only modifying the imports, the impact should be minimal.

4. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signature remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed.
   - The correct package is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
   - The `@Override` annotation is retained.

5. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to update the imports to use the `jakarta.mvc.locale` package. This change adheres to all constraints and resolves the compilation errors caused by the breaking dependency updates.
