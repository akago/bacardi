1. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
   - The error occurs in the line `Models models;` where the class `javax.mvc.Models` is no longer available.
   - The API change indicates that `javax.mvc.Models` has been removed and replaced by `jakarta.mvc.Models`.

2. **Specific API changes causing the issue:**
   - The class `javax.mvc.Models` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The new interface `jakarta.mvc.Models` has been added.

3. **Affected lines of code:**
   - `Models models;`

4. **Proposed fixes for each affected line:**
   - Replace `javax.mvc.Models` with `jakarta.mvc.Models` in the import statement and the variable declaration.

5. **Potential side effects of the proposed changes:**
   - The change should not have any side effects as the new interface `jakarta.mvc.Models` is a direct replacement for the removed class `javax.mvc.Models`.

6. **Adherence to constraints:**
   - The function signature of `toResponse` remains unchanged.
   - No new variables are created.
   - The `@Override` annotation is retained as the method still overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
   - The correct package `jakarta.mvc.Models` is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
   - No existing code is removed except for the import statement causing the compilation error.
   - All code, including unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

7. **Final summary of the chosen fix:**
   - The best solution is to update the import statement and the variable declaration to use `jakarta.mvc.Models` instead of `javax.mvc.Models`. This change directly addresses the compilation error caused by the API change and adheres to all constraints.
