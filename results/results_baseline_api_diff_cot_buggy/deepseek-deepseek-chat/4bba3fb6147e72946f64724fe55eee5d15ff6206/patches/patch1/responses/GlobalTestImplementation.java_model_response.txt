1. Analyze the problem and propose changes:
   a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
      - The code uses `@Priority(100)` and imports `javax.annotation.Priority`.
      - The API changes indicate that `javax.annotation.Priority` has been removed and replaced with `jakarta.annotation.Priority`.

   b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
      - The removal of `javax.annotation.Priority` and its replacement with `jakarta.annotation.Priority`.

   c. Affected lines of code:
      - `import javax.annotation.Priority;`
      - `@Priority(100)`

   d. Propose potential fixes for each affected line:
      - Replace `import javax.annotation.Priority;` with `import jakarta.annotation.Priority;`.
      - Keep `@Priority(100)` unchanged as the annotation itself remains the same, only the package has changed.

   e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
      - The change in import statement should not have any side effects as long as the new package `jakarta.annotation.Priority` is available in the classpath.

   f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
      - The function signature of any method is not changed.
      - No variables are created.
      - No `@Override` annotations are removed.
      - The correct package is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
      - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
      - All code, even unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

   g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
      - The best solution is to update the import statement to use the new package `jakarta.annotation.Priority`. This change directly addresses the compilation error caused by the missing `javax.annotation.Priority` class and adheres to all constraints.

2. Apply the fix to the Java code:
   - Replace `import javax.annotation.Priority;` with `import jakarta.annotation.Priority;`.
   - Keep `@Priority(100)` unchanged.

3. Output the complete, fixed Java class in a fenced code block.
