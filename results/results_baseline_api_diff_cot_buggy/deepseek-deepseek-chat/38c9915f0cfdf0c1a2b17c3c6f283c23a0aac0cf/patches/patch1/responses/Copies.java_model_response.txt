1. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
   - The code uses `org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf` to compare the size of ledgers in two wallets.
   - The API changes indicate that the `CollectionOf` class and its constructors have been removed.

2. **Specific API changes causing the issue:**
   - The `CollectionOf` class has been removed entirely, causing a compilation error.

3. **Affected lines of code:**
   - The line `import org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf;`
   - The line `new CollectionOf<>(first.ledger()).size() == new CollectionOf<>(second.ledger()).size();`

4. **Proposed fixes:**
   - Replace the use of `CollectionOf` with a standard Java collection, such as `ArrayList`, to achieve the same functionality.
   - Modify the `equalWallets` method to use `ArrayList` instead of `CollectionOf`.

5. **Potential side effects:**
   - The change from `CollectionOf` to `ArrayList` should not have any significant side effects since both are used to determine the size of the ledger.

6. **Adherence to constraints:**
   - The function signature of `equalWallets` remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed.
   - The fix only modifies the implementation of the `equalWallets` method.

7. **Final summary:**
   - The best solution is to replace `CollectionOf` with `ArrayList` since it provides the same functionality and adheres to all constraints.
