1. Analysis:
   a. The error occurs because `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   b. The API changes indicate that `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed and replaced with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`.
   c. The affected line is: `new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue() >= 16`
   d. Potential fix: Replace `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` and adjust the usage accordingly.
   e. Side effects: The functionality should remain the same since both classes are used to calculate the length of an iterable.
   f. Constraints check: The fix adheres to all constraints as it only changes the import and the class used, without modifying the method signature or removing any code.
   g. Summary: The best solution is to replace `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` since it's the direct replacement in the new API version.

2. Proposed fix:
   - Change the import from `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` to `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`
   - Keep the usage of `LengthOf` the same since the constructor signature remains compatible
