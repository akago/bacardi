1. Analysis:
   a. The error occurs because the class `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   b. The specific API change causing the issue is the removal of `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` and the addition of `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`.
   c. The affected line of code is:
      ```java
      import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;
      ```
   d. Potential fixes:
      - Replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`
      - Modify the usage of `LengthOf` to match the new API.
   e. Side effects:
      - The new `LengthOf` class in `org.cactoos.scalar` might have a different interface, so we need to ensure the usage is compatible.
   f. Constraints check:
      - The function signature of the constructor remains unchanged.
      - No existing code is removed.
      - The correct package is used in the import statement.
   g. Final summary:
      - The best solution is to replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;` and adjust the usage of `LengthOf` to match the new API.

2. Proposed fix:
   - Replace `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;` with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`
   - Modify the usage of `LengthOf` to match the new API.
