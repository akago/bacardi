1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The error occurs because the class `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The API changes indicate that `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` is now available and can be used with an `Iterable` as a parameter.

2. **Affected Lines:**
   - The import statement: `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;`
   - The usage of `LengthOf` in the `compareTo` method: `new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()` and `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue()`

3. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`
   - Update the usage of `LengthOf` in the `compareTo` method to use the new `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` class.

4. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The functionality of the `LengthOf` class might have changed, but since it still provides the `intValue()` method, the behavior should remain the same.

5. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signatures remain unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed.
   - The correct package is used for the import.
   - The `@Override` annotations are retained as the methods still override their respective interfaces.

6. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to update the import statement and the usage of `LengthOf` to match the new API. This fix adheres to all constraints and should resolve the compilation error without introducing new issues.
