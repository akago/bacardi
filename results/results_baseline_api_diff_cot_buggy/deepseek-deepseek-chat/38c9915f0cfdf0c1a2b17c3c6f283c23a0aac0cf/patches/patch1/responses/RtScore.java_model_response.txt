1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - **Relevant Code:** The issue is in the import statement `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;` and the usage of `LengthOf` in the `compareTo` method.
   - **API Changes:** The class `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` has been removed in the new version of the dependency. Instead, a new type reference `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf(java.lang.Iterable)` has been added.
   - **Affected Lines:**
     - `import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;`
     - `new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()`
     - `new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue()`
   - **Proposed Fixes:**
     - Replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`.
     - Update the usage of `LengthOf` to use the new scalar version.
   - **Potential Side Effects:**
     - The functionality should remain the same since the new `LengthOf` scalar class provides the same functionality but in a different package.
   - **Adherence to Constraints:**
     - The function signatures remain unchanged.
     - No existing code is removed.
     - The correct import is used according to the new dependency version.
   - **Final Summary:**
     - The best solution is to update the import statement and use the new `LengthOf` scalar class from `org.cactoos.scalar`. This adheres to all constraints and fixes the compilation error without altering the functionality.

2. **Application of the Fix:**
   - Replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;`.
   - No changes are needed in the usage of `LengthOf` since the constructor signature remains compatible with the new scalar version.
