<fix_planning>
1. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
   - The code uses `org.cactoos.text.RandomText` in the `Fake` constructor.
   - The `RandomText` class and all its constructors have been removed in the new version of the dependency.

2. **Specific API changes causing the issue:**
   - The removal of the `RandomText` class and its constructors.

3. **Affected lines of code:**
   - `import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;`
   - `new Repeated<>(val, new RandomText())`

4. **Potential fixes for each affected line:**
   - Replace `RandomText` with a different class or mechanism that can generate random text.
   - Use `org.cactoos.text.TextOf` or another text generation class if available.

5. **Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:**
   - The replacement should generate text in a similar manner to `RandomText` to maintain the expected behavior.

6. **Check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:**
   - The function signatures remain unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
   - The fix addresses the missing import and uses the correct package or class.

7. **Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:**
   - Replace `RandomText` with `TextOf` and use a simple string to generate text. This is a straightforward replacement that maintains the functionality without requiring complex changes.
