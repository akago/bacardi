1. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
   - The error occurs in the import statement: `import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;`
   - The class `IoCheckedScalar` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The constructor `IoCheckedScalar(org.cactoos.Scalar)` has also been removed.

2. **Specific API changes causing the issue:**
   - The removal of the `IoCheckedScalar` class and its constructor is the direct cause of the compilation error.

3. **Affected lines of code:**
   - The import statement: `import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;`
   - The line where `IoCheckedScalar` is used: `return new IoCheckedScalar<>(...)`

4. **Potential fixes:**
   - Replace `IoCheckedScalar` with an equivalent class or mechanism that handles checked exceptions in a similar way.
   - Use `org.cactoos.scalar.Unchecked` or `org.cactoos.scalar.Checked` if available in the new version.
   - Alternatively, wrap the scalar in a try-catch block to handle the `IOException`.

5. **Side effects of the proposed changes:**
   - Using `Unchecked` or `Checked` might change the exception handling behavior.
   - Wrapping in a try-catch block might introduce additional boilerplate code.

6. **Adherence to constraints:**
   - The function signature of `pull` remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
   - The fix only modifies the client code.

7. **Final summary of the chosen fix:**
   - The best solution is to replace `IoCheckedScalar` with `org.cactoos.scalar.Checked` if it is available in the new version. This maintains the checked exception handling behavior without introducing additional boilerplate code.

**Chosen Fix:**
Replace `IoCheckedScalar` with `Checked` from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package.
