1. Analysis:
   a. The error occurs because the class `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   b. The specific API change causing the issue is the removal of the `Tv` class.
   c. Affected lines:
      - `attempts = Tv.SEVEN,`
      - `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;`
   d. Potential fixes:
      - Replace `Tv.SEVEN` with a direct integer value `7`.
      - Remove the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`.
   e. Side effects:
      - The change is straightforward and should not affect the functionality since `Tv.SEVEN` was just a constant representing the number 7.
   f. Constraints check:
      - The function signature remains unchanged.
      - No new variables are created.
      - The `@Override` annotation is retained as the method still overrides a method in the parent class.
      - The import statement is removed as it is no longer needed.
      - No existing code is removed except for the import statement.
   g. Final summary:
      - The best solution is to replace `Tv.SEVEN` with `7` and remove the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. This adheres to all constraints and fixes the compilation error.
