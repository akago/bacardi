1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The error occurs because the `org.hamcrest.Matchers` class has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The affected line is the import statement: `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`.
   - The `Matchers` class was used in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods to create matchers for URI properties.

2. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Replace the import of `org.hamcrest.Matchers` with `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, which is the recommended replacement in newer versions of Hamcrest.
   - Update the usage of `Matchers` in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods to use `CoreMatchers` instead.

3. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The change should not affect the functionality of the code, as `CoreMatchers` provides the same functionality as `Matchers`.
   - The fix adheres to all constraints, as it does not change method signatures, removes any code, or introduces new functionality.

4. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to replace `org.hamcrest.Matchers` with `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` in both the import statement and the method implementations. This fix is straightforward, adheres to all constraints, and resolves the compilation error.
