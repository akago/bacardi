1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The errors indicate that the classes `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` have been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The API changes show that these classes have been replaced by their `jakarta.mvc` counterparts: `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext`.
   - The affected lines are:
     - `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext;`
     - `import javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver;`
     - `public class QueryParamLocaleResolver implements LocaleResolver {`
     - `public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context) {`

2. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` in the import statement.
   - Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` in the import statement.
   - The method `resolveLocale` should continue to use `LocaleResolverContext` from the `jakarta.mvc` package.
   - The `@Override` annotation should be retained since the method still overrides a method in the updated dependency version.

3. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The change in package names from `javax` to `jakarta` is a breaking change, but it is necessary to align with the updated dependency.
   - The functionality of the code remains unchanged, as the method signatures and behavior are consistent with the new API.

4. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signature of `resolveLocale` remains unchanged.
   - No variables are created as it is not necessary.
   - The `@Override` annotation is retained.
   - The correct package (`jakarta.mvc.locale`) is used for the imports.
   - No existing code is removed, only the import statements are updated.

5. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to update the import statements to use the `jakarta.mvc` package instead of `javax.mvc`. This aligns the code with the new API changes and resolves the compilation errors without altering the functionality or method signatures.
