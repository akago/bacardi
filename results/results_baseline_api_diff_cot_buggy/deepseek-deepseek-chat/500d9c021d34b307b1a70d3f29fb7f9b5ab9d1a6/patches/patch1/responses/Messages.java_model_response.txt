1. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
   - The code uses `javax.mvc.MvcContext` which has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The error occurs in the line: `private MvcContext mvcContext;`

2. **Specific API changes causing the issue:**
   - The class `javax.mvc.MvcContext` has been removed.

3. **Affected lines of code:**
   - `private MvcContext mvcContext;`
   - `@Inject private MvcContext mvcContext;`

4. **Potential fixes for each affected line:**
   - Replace `javax.mvc.MvcContext` with a suitable alternative that provides similar functionality, such as `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` if available.
   - Alternatively, use `Locale` directly from `java.util.Locale` if the locale resolution can be handled differently.

5. **Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:**
   - Changing the class to `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` might require updating other parts of the code that interact with `mvcContext`.
   - Using `Locale` directly might require changes in how the locale is resolved.

6. **Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:**
   - The function signature of `get` method remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
   - All code, even unchanged portions, is included in the final output.

7. **Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:**
   - The best solution is to replace `javax.mvc.MvcContext` with `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` as it is the most straightforward replacement and maintains the intended functionality with minimal changes.
