1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - **Relevant Code and API Changes:**
     - `Models models;` and `import javax.mvc.Models;` are affected because `javax.mvc.Models` has been removed and replaced with `jakarta.mvc.Models`.
     - `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;` and `MvcContext mvc;` are affected because `javax.mvc.MvcContext` has been removed.
     - `@Controller` is affected because `javax.mvc.Controller` has been removed and replaced with `jakarta.mvc.Controller`.

   - **Specific API Changes Causing the Issue:**
     - The package `javax.mvc` has been replaced with `jakarta.mvc` in the new version of the dependency.

   - **Affected Lines of Code:**
     - `Models models;`
     - `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;`
     - `@Controller`
     - `MvcContext mvc;`

   - **Proposed Fixes:**
     - Replace `import javax.mvc.Models;` with `import jakarta.mvc.Models;`.
     - Replace `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;` with `import jakarta.mvc.MvcContext;`.
     - Replace `@javax.mvc.Controller` with `@jakarta.mvc.Controller`.

   - **Potential Side Effects:**
     - The changes are straightforward and should not introduce any side effects since the new package `jakarta.mvc` is a direct replacement for `javax.mvc`.

   - **Adherence to Constraints:**
     - The function signatures remain unchanged.
     - No variables are created or removed.
     - No `@Override` annotations are present or removed.
     - Missing imports are addressed correctly.
     - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.

   - **Final Summary:**
     - The best solution is to update the imports and annotations to use the new `jakarta.mvc` package, which directly replaces the deprecated `javax.mvc` package. This solution adheres to all constraints and resolves the compilation errors without introducing any side effects.
