1. Analyze the problem and propose changes:
   a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
      - The code uses `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` which has been removed.
      - The new API uses `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`.
   b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
      - The `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` class has been removed and replaced by `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`.
   c. Affected lines of code:
      - `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;`
      - `@InterceptorBinding`
   d. Propose potential fixes for each affected line:
      - Replace `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;` with `import jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;`.
      - No change needed for `@InterceptorBinding` as the annotation itself remains the same, only the package has changed.
   e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
      - The change in import statement should not have any side effects as the annotation's functionality remains the same.
   f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
      - The function signature is not changed.
      - No variables are created.
      - No `@Override` annotations are removed.
      - The correct package is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
      - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
      - All code, including unchanged portions, is included in the final output.
   g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
      - The best solution is to update the import statement to use the new package `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`. This change directly addresses the compilation error caused by the removed `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` class and adheres to all constraints.
