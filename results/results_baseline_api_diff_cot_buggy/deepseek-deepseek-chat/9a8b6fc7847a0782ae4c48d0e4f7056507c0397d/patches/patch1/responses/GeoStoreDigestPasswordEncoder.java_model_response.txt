1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The class `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` and its constructors have been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The method `setPasswordEncryptor` has also been removed.
   - The affected lines are:
     ```java
     PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
     import org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder;
     protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
     ```

2. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Replace the removed `PasswordEncoder` class with a compatible alternative. Since the `PasswordEncoder` class is no longer available, we can use `org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor` directly.
   - Modify the `createStringEncoder` method to use `StrongPasswordEncryptor` directly without wrapping it in a `PasswordEncoder`.

3. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The change might affect other parts of the code that rely on the `PasswordEncoder` class. However, since the `PasswordEncoder` class was just a wrapper around `PasswordEncryptor`, the functionality should remain the same.

4. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signature of `createStringEncoder` remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed, only replaced with a compatible alternative.
   - The fix addresses the missing imports by using the correct package.

5. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to directly use `StrongPasswordEncryptor` in the `createStringEncoder` method, as it provides the same functionality without relying on the removed `PasswordEncoder` class.
