1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The errors are caused by the removal of several interfaces and classes in the newer version of the dependency. Specifically, the following interfaces/classes have been removed:
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.ClusterPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.RedisPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.MultiKeyCommandsPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.BasicRedisPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.BinaryRedisPipeline`
     - `redis.clients.jedis.commands.ScriptingCommandsPipeline`
   - The new version introduces a new interface `redis.clients.jedis.ClusterPipeline`, but it is not directly compatible with the old interfaces.

2. **Affected Lines of Code:**
   - The import statements for the removed interfaces/classes.
   - The interface declaration where `RedisGraphTransaction` extends the removed interfaces.

3. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Remove the import statements for the removed interfaces/classes.
   - Update the interface declaration to extend the new `redis.clients.jedis.ClusterPipeline` interface.
   - Since the other interfaces have been removed, we need to remove them from the `extends` clause in the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface.

4. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The removal of the interfaces may affect the functionality of the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface, as it may no longer inherit certain methods. However, since the methods in `RedisGraphTransaction` are explicitly defined, this should not cause immediate issues.

5. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signatures of the methods in `RedisGraphTransaction` remain unchanged.
   - No variables are created, as it is not necessary.
   - The `@Override` annotation is not used in this interface, so no changes are needed there.
   - The correct package for the new `ClusterPipeline` interface is used.
   - No existing code is removed except for the import statements and the removed interfaces in the `extends` clause.

6. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to remove the import statements for the removed interfaces and update the `extends` clause to include only the new `ClusterPipeline` interface. This adheres to the constraints and resolves the compilation errors.
