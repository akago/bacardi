1. Analysis:
   a. The code uses `com.hazelcast.core.Member` which has been removed in the new version. The new version introduces `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
   b. The method `getStringAttribute(String)` has been removed, and `getSocketAddress()` has been replaced with `getSocketAddress(EndpointQualifier)`.
   c. Affected lines:
      - `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;`
      - `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
      - `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";`
   d. Proposed fixes:
      - Replace `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`
      - Replace `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)` with a different way to get the hostname, possibly using `member.getAddress().getHost()`
      - Replace `member.getSocketAddress().getHostString()` with `member.getAddress().getHost()`
   e. Potential side effects:
      - The hostname format might change slightly due to the different method of obtaining it.
   f. Constraints check:
      - The function signature remains unchanged.
      - No existing code is removed.
      - The correct import is used.
   g. Final summary:
      - The best solution is to update the import and modify the hostname construction to use the new API methods. This adheres to all constraints and fixes the compilation errors.
