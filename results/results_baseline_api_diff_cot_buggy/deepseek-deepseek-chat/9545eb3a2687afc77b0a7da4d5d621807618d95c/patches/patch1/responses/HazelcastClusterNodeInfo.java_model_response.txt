1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The error occurs because the `com.hazelcast.core.Member` class has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   - The new version introduces `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member` as a replacement.
   - The method `getSocketAddress()` has been moved to `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
   - The method `getStringAttribute(String)` has been removed entirely.

2. **Affected Lines:**
   - `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;`
   - `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
   - `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";`

3. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Replace `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`.
   - Replace `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)` with a placeholder or alternative method since `getStringAttribute` is no longer available.
   - Use `member.getSocketAddress()` directly since it is now available in `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.

4. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The removal of `getStringAttribute` might affect the `hostname` construction. We need to ensure that the `hostname` is still meaningful.

5. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signature of `HazelcastClusterNodeInfo` remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
   - The fix addresses missing imports correctly.

6. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to update the import statement and modify the `hostname` construction to use available methods. Since `getStringAttribute` is no longer available, we can use a placeholder or alternative method to construct the `hostname`.

**Chosen Fix:**
- Update the import statement to use `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
- Modify the `hostname` construction to use `member.getSocketAddress().getHostString()` directly, omitting the `getStringAttribute` part.
