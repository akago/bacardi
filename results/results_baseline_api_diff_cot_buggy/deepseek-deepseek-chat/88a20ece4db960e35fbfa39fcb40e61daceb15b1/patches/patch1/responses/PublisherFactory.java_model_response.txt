1. Analysis:
   a. The error occurs because the class `PublishMetadata` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   b. The specific API change causing the issue is the removal of the `PublishMetadata` class.
   c. Affected lines:
      - `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
      - `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`
   d. Potential fixes:
      - Remove the import statement for `PublishMetadata`.
      - Replace `PublishMetadata` with a suitable alternative type or remove it if no longer needed.
   e. Side effects:
      - The change might affect other parts of the code that depend on `PublishMetadata`.
   f. Constraints check:
      - The function signature of `newPublisher` must remain unchanged.
      - The fix adheres to all constraints by only modifying the necessary parts of the code.
   g. Final summary:
      - The best solution is to remove the import statement and replace `PublishMetadata` with a suitable alternative type. Since the class has been removed, we can use `Object` as a placeholder to maintain the function signature.

2. Apply the fix:
   - Remove the import statement for `PublishMetadata`.
   - Replace `PublishMetadata` with `Object` in the method signature.
