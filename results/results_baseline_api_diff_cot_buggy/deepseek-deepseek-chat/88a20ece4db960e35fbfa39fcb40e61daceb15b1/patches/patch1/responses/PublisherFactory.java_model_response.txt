1. **Relevant parts of the code and API changes:**
   - The class `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` has been removed.
   - The constructor `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata()` has been removed.
   - The affected lines are:
     ```java
     import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;
     ```
     ```java
     Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
     ```

2. **Specific API changes causing the issue:**
   - The removal of `PublishMetadata` class directly affects the import statement and the method signature.

3. **Affected lines of code:**
   - Line with the import statement.
   - Line with the method signature using `PublishMetadata`.

4. **Proposed fixes:**
   - Since `PublishMetadata` has been removed, we need to find a suitable replacement or remove the generic type if it's no longer needed.
   - If `PublishMetadata` was used for metadata, we might need to use a different class or remove the generic type entirely.

5. **Potential side effects:**
   - Removing the generic type might affect the functionality if `PublishMetadata` was used to pass specific metadata.
   - If no replacement is available, the method might need to be adjusted to work without metadata.

6. **Adherence to constraints:**
   - The function signature cannot be changed, so we need to find a way to keep the signature intact while fixing the issue.
   - We cannot remove existing code unless it directly causes a compilation error.

7. **Final summary of the chosen fix:**
   - Since `PublishMetadata` has been removed and no direct replacement is provided, the best solution is to remove the generic type from the `Publisher` interface. This will keep the method signature intact while resolving the compilation error.

**Chosen Fix:**
- Remove the generic type `PublishMetadata` from the `Publisher` interface.
