1. Analysis:
   a. The error occurs because the `org.hamcrest.Matchers` class has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   b. The specific API change causing the issue is the removal of the `org.hamcrest.Matchers` class.
   c. The affected line is the import statement: `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;` and the usage of `Matchers` in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods.
   d. Potential fixes:
      - Replace `Matchers` with `CoreMatchers` from the `org.hamcrest` package, which is the recommended replacement in newer versions of Hamcrest.
      - Update the import statement to use `CoreMatchers` instead of `Matchers`.
   e. Side effects:
      - The change should not affect the functionality of the code since `CoreMatchers` provides the same functionality as `Matchers`.
   f. The proposed changes adhere to all constraints:
      - The function signatures remain unchanged.
      - No code is removed except for the problematic import.
      - The correct package is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
   g. Final summary:
      - The best solution is to replace `Matchers` with `CoreMatchers` in both the import statement and the code. This is the recommended approach in newer versions of Hamcrest and maintains the same functionality.

2. Fix:
   - Replace `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;` with `import org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers;`.
   - Replace `Matchers.<URI>hasProperty` with `CoreMatchers.<URI>hasProperty` in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods.
