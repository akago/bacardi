1. Analyze the problem and propose changes:
   a. Relevant parts of the code and API changes:
      - The class `org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
      - The affected lines are:
        ```java
        import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;
        private final CommandSource invoker;
        public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, String targetName, Player receiver, boolean keepSkin)
        ```

   b. Specific API changes causing the issue:
      - The `CommandSource` class has been removed, which is used in the `NameResolver` class.

   c. Affected lines of code:
      - Import statement: `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;`
      - Field declaration: `private final CommandSource invoker;`
      - Constructor parameter: `public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, String targetName, Player receiver, boolean keepSkin)`

   d. Propose potential fixes for each affected line:
      - Replace `CommandSource` with a suitable alternative, such as `org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource` or `org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause` if available in the new API.
      - Update the import statement to reflect the new class.

   e. Consider any potential side effects of the proposed changes:
      - The new class might have different methods or behavior, which could affect the functionality of the `sendMessageInvoker` method.

   f. Explicitly check if the proposed changes adhere to all the given constraints:
      - The function signature of the constructor is not changed.
      - No existing code is removed unless it directly causes a compilation error.
      - The correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.

   g. Final summary of the chosen fix and why it's the best solution:
      - Replace `CommandSource` with `org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource` as it is the most likely replacement in the new API. This change adheres to all constraints and should resolve the compilation errors.

2. Apply the fix to the Java code:
   - Update the import statement to use the new class.
   - Update the field declaration and constructor parameter to use the new class.

3. Output the complete, fixed Java class in a fenced code block.
