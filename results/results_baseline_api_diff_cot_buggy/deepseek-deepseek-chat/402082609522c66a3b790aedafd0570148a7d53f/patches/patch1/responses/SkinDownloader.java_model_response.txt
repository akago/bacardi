1. Analyze the problem and propose changes:
   a. Relevant parts of the code:
      - `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;`
      - `private final CommandSource invoker;`
      - `public SkinDownloader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, Player receiver, UUID targetUUID, boolean keepSkin)`
   b. API changes causing the issue:
      - `Class org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource has been removed in the new version of the dependency.`
   c. Affected lines of code:
      - Line with `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;`
      - Line with `private final CommandSource invoker;`
      - Line with `public SkinDownloader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, Player receiver, UUID targetUUID, boolean keepSkin)`
   d. Potential fixes:
      - Replace `CommandSource` with a suitable alternative from the new API. Based on the context, `CommandCause` or `CommandExecutor` might be appropriate replacements.
      - Update the import statement to reflect the new class.
   e. Side effects:
      - The new class might have different methods or behavior, which could require additional changes in the code.
   f. Adherence to constraints:
      - The function signature of the constructor remains unchanged.
      - No existing code is removed.
      - The fix addresses the missing import and class usage.
   g. Final summary:
      - Replace `CommandSource` with `CommandCause` as it is a common replacement in newer versions of SpongeAPI. Update the import statement accordingly.

2. Apply the fix to the Java code:
   - Replace `CommandSource` with `CommandCause`.
   - Update the import statement to `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause;`.
