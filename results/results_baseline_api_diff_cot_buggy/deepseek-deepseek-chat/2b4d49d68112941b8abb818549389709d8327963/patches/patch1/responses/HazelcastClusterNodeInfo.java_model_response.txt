1. **Analysis of the Problem:**
   - The error messages indicate that the `com.hazelcast.core.Member` class cannot be found, and the `getStringAttribute` and `getSocketAddress` methods are no longer available in the new version of the Hazelcast dependency.
   - The API changes show that `com.hazelcast.core.Member` has been removed and replaced by `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.
   - The `getStringAttribute` method has been removed, and the `getSocketAddress` method has been updated to use `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`.

2. **Affected Lines of Code:**
   - `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;`
   - `public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final Member member, final long joinedTime) {`
   - `this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";`

3. **Proposed Fixes:**
   - Replace `import com.hazelcast.core.Member;` with `import com.hazelcast.cluster.Member;`.
   - Replace `member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)` with an alternative way to get the hostname, such as using `member.getAddress().getHost()`.
   - Replace `member.getSocketAddress().getHostString()` with `member.getAddress().getHost()`.

4. **Potential Side Effects:**
   - The new `getAddress()` method might return a different format or require additional handling.
   - The `getHost()` method might not be available directly, requiring further adjustments.

5. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - The function signature of `HazelcastClusterNodeInfo` remains unchanged.
   - No existing code is removed, only modified to use the new API.
   - The correct import is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.

6. **Final Summary:**
   - The best solution is to update the import and use the new `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member` class, and replace the deprecated methods with their new equivalents. This ensures compatibility with the updated Hazelcast API while maintaining the original functionality.
