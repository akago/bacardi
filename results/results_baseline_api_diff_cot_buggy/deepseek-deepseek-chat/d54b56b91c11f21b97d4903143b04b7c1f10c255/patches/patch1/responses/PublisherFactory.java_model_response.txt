1. Analysis:
   a. The error messages indicate that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found, and the import statement for `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` is causing an error.
   b. The API changes state that the class `PublishMetadata` has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
   c. Affected lines:
      - `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
      - `Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);`
   d. Potential fixes:
      - Remove the import statement for `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata`.
      - Replace `PublishMetadata` with a suitable alternative or remove it from the `Publisher` generic type if no longer needed.
   e. Side effects:
      - Removing `PublishMetadata` from the `Publisher` generic type might affect the type safety and functionality of the code.
   f. Constraints:
      - The function signature of `newPublisher` must not be changed.
      - The fix must adhere to the constraints provided.
   g. Final summary:
      - The best solution is to remove the import statement for `PublishMetadata` and replace `PublishMetadata` with `Void` in the `Publisher` generic type, as it is a common placeholder when no specific metadata is needed. This adheres to the constraints and resolves the compilation error.

2. Apply the fix:
   - Remove the import statement for `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata`.
   - Replace `PublishMetadata` with `Void` in the `Publisher` generic type.
