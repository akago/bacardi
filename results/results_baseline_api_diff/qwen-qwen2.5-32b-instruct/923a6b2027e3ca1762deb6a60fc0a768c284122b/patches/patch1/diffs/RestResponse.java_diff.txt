<  * <p>This response decorator is able to make basic assertions on
<  * HTTP response and manipulate with it afterwords, for example:
<  *
<  * <pre> String name = new JdkRequest("http://my.example.com")
<  *   .fetch()
<  *   .as(RestResponse.class)
<  *   .assertStatus(200)
<  *   .assertBody(Matchers.containsString("hello, world!"))
<  *   .assertHeader("Content-Type", Matchers.hasItem("text/plain"))
<  *   .jump(URI.create("/users"))
<  *   .fetch();</pre>
<  *
<  * <p>Method {@link #jump(URI)} creates a new instance of class
<  * {@link Request} with all cookies transferred from the current one.
<  *
<  * <p>The class is immutable and thread-safe.
