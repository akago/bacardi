1. The specific API change is that the class com.jcabi.aspects.Tv has been removed, which directly impacts any references to its constants.
2. In the previous code, Tv.HUNDRED and Tv.THOUSAND were used to define the length of a random string. The new API no longer provides these constants.
3. The client code needs to be updated by replacing these references with literal values (e.g., 100 and 1000) since Tv.HUNDRED * Tv.THOUSAND equals 100 * 1000.
4. The constraints require that function signatures remain unchanged and that only minimal modifications are performed. We also need to remove the now-broken import.
5. The minimal changes include removing the Tv import and updating the arithmetic expression in the random string generation.
6. There are no side effects since these constants only served as numeric multipliers.
7. The final class will be complete and compilable.
8. No additional imports are needed.
