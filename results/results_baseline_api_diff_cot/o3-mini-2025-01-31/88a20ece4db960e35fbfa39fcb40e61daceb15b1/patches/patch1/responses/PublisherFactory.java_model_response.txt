1. The client code references the class com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata in both the import and the generic return type of the newPublisher method.
2. The updated dependency has removed PublishMetadata (including its constructor) entirely, so any references to it cause compilation errors.
3. To fix this with minimal changes while retaining the method name and parameter list, we update the generic parameter for Publisher from PublishMetadata to a type that does not rely on the removed class.
4. In this case, we use Void as the type parameter because the publishing metadata is no longer provided, and Void is a standard placeholder.
5. We also remove the now-invalid import of PublishMetadata.
6. These minimal changes ensure the code compiles and conforms to the updated dependency API.
