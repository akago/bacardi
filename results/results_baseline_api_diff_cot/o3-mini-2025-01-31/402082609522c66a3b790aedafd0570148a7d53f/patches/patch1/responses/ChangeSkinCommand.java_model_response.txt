1. The error occurs because the class CommandSpec (in package org.spongepowered.api.command.spec) has been removed from the dependency.
2. In the updated Sponge API, command definitions are now built using a new type – the Command interface – available under org.spongepowered.api.command.
3. Therefore, we replace the import of CommandSpec with the appropriate import for Command and update the return type of buildSpec() accordingly.
4. This is the minimal change needed so that the client code compiles under the new dependency while keeping the method signature (name and parameters) unchanged.

import org.spongepowered.api.command.Command;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    Command buildSpec();
