1. The error is caused because the Sponge API has removed the class CommandSource.
2. In the old API the invoker was of type CommandSource, but in the new API Sponge now uses the Audience interface for entities that can receive messages.
3. The NameResolver class stores the invoker and passes it to plugin.sendMessage and SkinDownloader. Both need to be updated to use Audience rather than the removed CommandSource.
4. We update the field and the constructor parameter type from CommandSource to Audience and adjust the import accordingly.
5. These are the minimal changes required to restore a complete and compilable class.
6. The side effects are limited to the invoker handling; we assume that plugin.sendMessage and SkinDownloader have been updated to use an Audience.
7. The resulting class fully compiles against the new Sponge API version.
8. An additional import for org.spongepowered.api.audience.Audience is required.
