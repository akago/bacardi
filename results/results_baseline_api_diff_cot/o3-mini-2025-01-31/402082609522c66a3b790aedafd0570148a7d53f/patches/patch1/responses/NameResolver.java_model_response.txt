1. The error occurs because the class CommandSource has been removed from its original package (org.spongepowered.api.command) in the new dependency version.
2. In the new API the CommandSource class has been relocated to a different package. This update requires changing the import statement.
3. The only part of the client code needing adjustment is the import for CommandSource. All usages of CommandSource in the class remain valid if imported from the new package location.
4. The constraints require that we do not change any method signatures or remove existing code that is not causing compile errors.
5. The minimal change is to update the import statement to reference the new package (org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource). This ensures that all references to CommandSource are valid.
6. This change has no side effects because the underlying API remains functionally equivalent.
7. The resulting NameResolver class will fully compile.
8. No extra imports are necessary apart from updating the CommandSource import.
