1. The failure is caused because the class org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource has been removed from the new dependency.
2. In the old API, CommandSource was used for handling command invocations. In the new API, a similar concept is represented by CommandCause.
3. We need to update the SkinDownloader class so that it no longer refers to CommandSource; instead, we replace it with CommandCause.
4. The constructor and field for “invoker” are currently of type CommandSource. We must change both to CommandCause. We also update the import statement accordingly.
5. These minimal changes ensure that scheduleApplyTask and sendMessageInvoker still function correctly (assuming that ChangeSkinSponge and SkinApplier have been similarly updated).
6. No other part of the code is affected by the API change.
7. The planned changes yield a complete and compilable class.
8. Required additional import is org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause.
