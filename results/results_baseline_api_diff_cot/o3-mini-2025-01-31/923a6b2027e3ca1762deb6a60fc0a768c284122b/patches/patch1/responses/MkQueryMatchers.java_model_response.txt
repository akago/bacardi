1. The error indicates that the class org.hamcrest.Matchers is no longer available in the updated dependency.
2. In the old version, Matchers.hasProperty was used to create matchers for bean properties. In the new API, similar functionality is provided by the static method hasProperty from the class org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.
3. The parts of the code that need to be updated are the two methods hasPath and hasQuery that reference Matchers.<URI>hasProperty(...).
4. The fix requires replacing "Matchers.<URI>hasProperty" with "HasPropertyWithValue.hasProperty", and updating the imports accordingly.
5. The change is minimal: remove the import for org.hamcrest.Matchers and add an import for org.hamcrest.beans.HasPropertyWithValue.
6. Since the methods in MkQueryMatchers delegate to the Matchers from hamcrest, the fix does not affect other parts of the code.
7. The resulting class remains complete and compilable.
8. The additional import from org.hamcrest.beans is necessary to access the new hasProperty method.
