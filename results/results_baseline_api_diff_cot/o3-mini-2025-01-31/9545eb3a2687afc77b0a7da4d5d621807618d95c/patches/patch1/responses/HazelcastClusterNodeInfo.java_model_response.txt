1. The error shows that the class Member in package com.hazelcast.core no longer exists. The new API now provides the Member interface in the package com.hazelcast.cluster.
2. In addition, the method getStringAttribute(String) has been removed. The new API provides member attribute access via getAttribute(String), which returns an Object (so it must be cast to String).
3. The usage of getSocketAddress() remains, since the new API added a no-argument version on com.hazelcast.cluster.Member that returns an object with getHostString(), similar to the previous behavior.
4. We need to update the import to com.hazelcast.cluster.Member and update the call from member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) to (String) member.getAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE).
5. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
6. This minimal change resolves the dependency API break while keeping function signatures and behavior.
