1. The error is caused because the client code imports InterceptorBinding from the old package (javax.interceptor) which has been removed in the new dependency version.
2. The new API introduces jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding. There are no changes to method signatures, return types, or parameters.
3. The only necessary update is to change the import statement for InterceptorBinding.
4. The fix simply involves updating the import statement from javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding to jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding.
5. This is a minimal change that directly targets the compilation error while retaining all functionality.
6. Since only the import is updated, there are no adverse side effects.
7. The resulting class will be complete, compilable, and comply with the new API.
8. The additional import required is jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding.
