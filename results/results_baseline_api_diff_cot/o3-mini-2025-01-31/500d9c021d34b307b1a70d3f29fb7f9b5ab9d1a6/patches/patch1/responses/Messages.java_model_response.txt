1. The API change removes the class javax.mvc.MvcContext, which means that the code can no longer inject and use that type.
2. In previous versions, MvcContext provided a method getLocale() to derive the request locale (often through the LocaleResolver). In the new version, this class is removed.
3. To update the client code, we can use the servlet API: HttpServletRequest has a getLocale() method that returns the requestâ€™s Locale.
4. We need to remove the injection and import for MvcContext and instead inject HttpServletRequest.
5. The minimal change is to update the field injection and change the get() method to use request.getLocale() instead of mvcContext.getLocale(). We are allowed to modify internal code but not the function signatures.
6. The only side effect is that the locale resolution now directly uses the HttpServletRequest rather than any MVC-specific LocaleResolver, which typically is acceptable.
7. The resulting class will compile in the new dependency environment.
8. Additionally, we update the Javadoc references accordingly and add the necessary import for HttpServletRequest.
