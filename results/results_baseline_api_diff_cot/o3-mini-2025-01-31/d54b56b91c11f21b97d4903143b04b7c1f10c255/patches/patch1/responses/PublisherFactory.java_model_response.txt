<repair_strategy>
1. The breaking dependency update reveals that the class PublishMetadata has been removed.
2. Previously, the code used PublishMetadata as the generic parameter for Publisher. With its removal, we now must update the Publisher generic parameter.
3. Since the new API no longer supports a PublishMetadata type, the use of metadata is no longer required for the Publisher.
4. The minimal fix, without modifying method parameters or broader functionality, is to remove the import for PublishMetadata and change the return type from Publisher<PublishMetadata> to Publisher<Void>.
5. By returning Publisher<Void>, we comply with the new API while preserving the method signature style.
6. The rest of the code (the interface and method signature) remains intact to avoid side effects.
7. This change results in a complete and compilable class.
8. No additional imports are required since Void is part of java.lang.
