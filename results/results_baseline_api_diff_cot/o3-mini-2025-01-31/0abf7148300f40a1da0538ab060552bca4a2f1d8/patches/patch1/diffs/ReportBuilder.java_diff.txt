> 1. The new dependency version has removed the setLineWidth(float) method from JRPen.
> 2. This leads to a type incompatibility error because the client code calls setLineWidth with an int value.
> 3. The fix is to remove the call to setLineWidth in the prepareTextfieldWithBorder method.
> 4. Only the line invoking setLineWidth is removed while preserving other configurations (line color and style).
> 5. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
> </repair_strategy>
