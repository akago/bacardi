1. The errors arise because the class com.hazelcast.core.Member has been removed. The new API provides the interface com.hazelcast.cluster.Member.
2. The old call to member.getStringAttribute(message) is no longer valid since that method was removed; the new API exposes a similar way to obtain member attributes via member.getAttribute(String) (which returns an Object and can be cast to String).
3. The client code in the constructor uses member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) and member.getSocketAddress(), which must be updated. The getSocketAddress() call is still valid as the new API adds a similar method on com.hazelcast.cluster.Member.
4. We update the import to use com.hazelcast.cluster.Member instead of com.hazelcast.core.Member. We then replace the call to member.getStringAttribute with a call to member.getAttribute, casting its result to a String.
5. We cast the result of member.getSocketAddress() to InetSocketAddress to safely call getHostString() on it.
6. This minimal change ensures that the overall functionality remains the same while the code becomes compilable under the new Hazelcast API.
