package com.google.pubsublite.kafka.sink;

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.MessageMetadata;
import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.Publisher;
import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<MessageMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **API Change Analysis**: The class `PublishMetadata` has been removed in the new version of the dependency. This class was previously used as a type parameter in the `Publisher` interface.
2. **Replacement**: The `PublishMetadata` class has been replaced by `MessageMetadata` in the new API. This is a direct replacement, and the functionality remains similar.
3. **Fix Implementation**: The type parameter in the `Publisher` interface has been updated from `PublishMetadata` to `MessageMetadata`.
4. **Imports**: The import statement for `PublishMetadata` has been replaced with `MessageMetadata`.
5. **Function Signature**: The method signature of `newPublisher` remains unchanged, ensuring compatibility with existing code that uses this interface.

This fix ensures that the client code compiles and functions correctly with the updated dependency.
