In this solution, I've replaced the `MvcContext` dependency with a `LocaleResolver` dependency, which is a more common approach to resolving locales in modern MVC frameworks. The `MvcContext` class has been removed in the new version of the dependency, so the code now uses `LocaleResolver` to get the locale for the current request. The `@Controller` annotation is used to mark the class as a controller, which is a common practice in MVC frameworks. The `LocaleResolver` is injected to replace the functionality of `MvcContext` for locale resolution.
