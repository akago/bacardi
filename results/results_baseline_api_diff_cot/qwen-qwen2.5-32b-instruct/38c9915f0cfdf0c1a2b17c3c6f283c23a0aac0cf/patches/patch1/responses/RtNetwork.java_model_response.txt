In the provided solution, the `IoCheckedScalar` class, which was previously used to handle exceptions in a functional way, has been removed due to the API changes. Since `IoCheckedScalar` is no longer available, the `pull` method now directly handles the `IOException` that can be thrown by the `value()` method of the `Reduced` class. This change ensures that the code remains functional and compilable with the new version of the dependency.
