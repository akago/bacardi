  1. The failure is due to the removal of the classes and constructors in the new version of the dependency.
  2. The old API had classes DetectionsResourceItems, LanguagesResource, and TranslationsResource, which are now removed.
  3. The client code needs to be updated to use the new API, which likely involves replacing the removed classes with new ones or using alternative methods.
  4. The function signatures cannot be changed, but we can introduce new variables or methods if necessary.
  5. The minimal set of changes would involve replacing the removed classes with new ones or using alternative methods provided by the new API.
  6. Potential side effects include changes in behavior if the new API methods do not behave exactly like the old ones.
  7. Ensure that the class is fully compilable and adheres to the new API.
  8. The new API might require different imports, which should be added.
