```java
package liquibase.ext.mssql.database;

import liquibase.CatalogAndSchema;
import liquibase.exception.LiquibaseException;
import liquibase.database.Database;
import liquibase.ext.mssql.statement.DropStoredProcedureStatement;

public class MSSQLDatabase extends liquibase.database.core.MSSQLDatabase {
    
    @Override
    public int getPriority() {
        return PRIORITY_DATABASE;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void dropDatabaseObjects(CatalogAndSchema schemaToDrop) throws LiquibaseException {
        super.dropDatabaseObjects(schemaToDrop);
        Database database = this;
        new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()).execute(database);
    }
}
```

In the provided solution, the `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(...)` line was replaced with a direct call to the `execute` method on the `DropStoredProcedureStatement` object, passing the current `MSSQLDatabase` instance as the `Database` parameter. This is based on the assumption that the `execute` method on `DropStoredProcedureStatement` can be called directly with a `Database` instance, as the old `ExecutorService` method was likely used to execute statements against a database. The `ExecutorService` and its `getInstance` method are no longer available, so this approach bypasses the need for that service.
