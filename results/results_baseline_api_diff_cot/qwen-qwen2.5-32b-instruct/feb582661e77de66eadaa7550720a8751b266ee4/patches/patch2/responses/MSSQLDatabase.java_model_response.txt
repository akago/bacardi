```java
package liquibase.ext.mssql.database;

import liquibase.CatalogAndSchema;
import liquibase.exception.LiquibaseException;
import liquibase.executor.Executor;
import liquibase.executor.ExecutorService;
import liquibase.ext.mssql.statement.DropStoredProcedureStatement;

public class MSSQLDatabase extends liquibase.database.core.MSSQLDatabase {
    
    @Override
    public int getPriority() {
        return PRIORITY_DATABASE;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void dropDatabaseObjects(CatalogAndSchema schemaToDrop) throws LiquibaseException {
        super.dropDatabaseObjects(schemaToDrop);
        Executor executor = ExecutorService.getExecutor(this);
        executor.execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));
    }
}
```

In the provided solution, the `ExecutorService.getInstance()` call has been replaced with `ExecutorService.getExecutor(this)`, which is a method that now exists in the updated dependency. This change ensures that the code is compatible with the new version of the dependency and resolves the compilation error. The rest of the class remains unchanged to ensure that the functionality is preserved.
