package com.google.pubsublite.kafka.sink;

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.Publisher;
import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}
```

In the provided solution, the `PublishMetadata` type parameter has been removed from the `Publisher` interface method `newPublisher` as the `PublishMetadata` class has been removed in the new version of the dependency. This change ensures that the client code is compatible with the updated dependency API and should compile without errors.
