import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<MessageMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}
```

In the solution provided, `PublishMetadata` has been replaced with `MessageMetadata` to align with the changes in the dependency API. This change is based on the assumption that `MessageMetadata` is the appropriate replacement for `PublishMetadata` in the new version of the dependency. If `MessageMetadata` is not the correct replacement, the appropriate class or type should be used instead.
