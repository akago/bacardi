```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

// Import the new class that replaces CommandSpec, if applicable.
// If there is no direct replacement, the import might be removed or replaced with a new one.
// Assuming there is a new class named NewCommandSpec that replaces CommandSpec.
import org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.NewCommandSpec;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    // Assuming the new class NewCommandSpec is a direct replacement for CommandSpec.
    NewCommandSpec buildSpec();
}
```

Note: The above solution assumes that there is a new class `NewCommandSpec` that replaces `CommandSpec`. If the new version of the dependency does not provide a direct replacement for `CommandSpec`, the solution would need to be adjusted based on the new API design. If there is no replacement, the method `buildSpec` would need to be redesigned to fit the new API, which might involve changing the return type or the method's implementation. However, without specific information on the new API design, this is a general approach to address the compilation error.
