```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandExecutor;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    CommandExecutor buildExecutor();
}
```

In this solution, I've replaced `CommandSpec` with `CommandExecutor` as it seems to be a more appropriate replacement given the context. The method `buildSpec()` has been renamed to `buildExecutor()` to reflect the change in the return type. This change should align with the new API and resolve the compilation errors.
