```java
package com.example.web;

import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.mvc.Controller;
import jakarta.mvc.Models;
import jakarta.mvc.MvcContext;

/**

@Path("locale")
@Controller
@RequestScoped
public class LocaleController {

    @Inject
    MvcContext mvc;

    @Inject
    Models models;

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @GET
    public String get() {
        Locale locale = mvc.getLocale();
        models.put("locale", locale);
        return "locale.xhtml";
    }

}
```

In the provided solution, the package imports for `javax.mvc.MvcContext`, `javax.mvc.Models`, and `javax.mvc.Controller` have been updated to their new `jakarta.mvc` counterparts. This change is necessary due to the removal of the `javax.mvc` package and the introduction of the `jakarta.mvc` package in the new version of the dependency. The class `MvcContext` has been removed, but since it is still used in the code, it is assumed that the `MvcContext` class has been replaced by a similar class in the `jakarta.mvc` package. If this is not the case, further investigation into the new API documentation would be required to find the correct replacement.
