```

In this solution, the `MvcContext` class has been replaced with `LocaleResolver` from the `jakarta.mvc.locale` package, as `MvcContext` has been removed in the new version of the dependency. The `mvcContext.getLocale()` call has been replaced with `localeResolver.resolveLocale()` to maintain the functionality of resolving the locale for the current request. The import statements have been updated to reflect the changes in the package names from `javax` to `jakarta` as per the new dependency version.
