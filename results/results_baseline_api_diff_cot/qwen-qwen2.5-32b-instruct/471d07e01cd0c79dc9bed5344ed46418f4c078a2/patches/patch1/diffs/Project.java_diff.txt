<    * <p>This method will only affect the project if the following criteria are met:
<    *
<    * <ul>
<    *   <li>The project does not have a billing account associated with it.
<    *   <li>The project has a lifecycle state of {@link ProjectInfo.State#ACTIVE}.
<    * </ul>
<    *
<    * This method changes the project's lifecycle state from {@link ProjectInfo.State#ACTIVE} to
<    * {@link ProjectInfo.State#DELETE_REQUESTED}. The deletion starts at an unspecified time, at
<    * which point the lifecycle state changes to {@link ProjectInfo.State#DELETE_IN_PROGRESS}. Until
<    * the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state checked by retrieving the project
<    * with {@link ResourceManager#get}, and the project remains visible to {@link
<    * ResourceManager#list}. However, you cannot update the project. After the deletion completes,
<    * the project is not retrievable by the {@link ResourceManager#get} and {@link
<    * ResourceManager#list} methods. The caller must have modify permissions for this project.
