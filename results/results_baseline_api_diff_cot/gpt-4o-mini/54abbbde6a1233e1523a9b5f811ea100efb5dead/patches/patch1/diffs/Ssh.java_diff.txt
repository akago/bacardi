<  * <p>This class implements {@link Shell} interface. In order to use
<  * it, just make an instance and call
<  * {@link #exec(String, InputStream, OutputStream, OutputStream)} method:
<  *
<  * <pre> String hello = new Shell.Plain(
<  *   new SSH(
<  *     "ssh.example.com", 22,
<  *     "yegor", "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----..."
<  *   )
<  * ).exec("echo 'Hello, world!'");</pre>
<  *
<  * <p>It is highly recommended to use classes from {@link Shell} interface,
<  * they will simplify operations.</p>
<  *
<  * <p>Instances of this class are NOT reusable. Once you do
<  * {@link Ssh#exec(String, InputStream, OutputStream, OutputStream)},
<  * the connection is lost. You have to create a new {@link Ssh} object, if
<  * you need to execute a new command.</p>

<  * @todo #30:30min Refactor this class into smaller ones to avoid null
<  *  checking of passphrase. There should probably be separate classes for
<  *  encrypted/unencrypted private key.
