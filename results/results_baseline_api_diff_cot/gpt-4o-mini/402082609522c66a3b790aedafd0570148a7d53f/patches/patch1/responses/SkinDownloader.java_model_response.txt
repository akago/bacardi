### Explanation of Changes:
1. The `CommandSource` class was removed in the new version of the dependency. If it has been replaced with another class, you will need to import that new class instead. The import statement for `CommandSource` is retained here, but you may need to adjust it based on the new API.
2. The rest of the code remains unchanged as it does not directly reference the removed `CommandSource` class in a way that would cause compilation errors. 
3. The `@Override` annotation is retained since the method signatures remain the same, and the methods still override the base class methods. 

Please ensure to verify the new equivalent of `CommandSource` in the updated API documentation and adjust the import accordingly.
