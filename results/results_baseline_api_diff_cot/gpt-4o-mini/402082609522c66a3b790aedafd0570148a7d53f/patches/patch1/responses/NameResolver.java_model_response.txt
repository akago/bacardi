### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed CommandSource**: The `CommandSource` class has been removed from the API, so I replaced the type of `invoker` with `Object`. This is a placeholder until the new API provides a suitable replacement for `CommandSource`.
2. **Updated Constructor**: The constructor now accepts an `Object` for `invoker` instead of `CommandSource`.
3. **Maintained Functionality**: The rest of the code remains unchanged to ensure that the functionality is preserved as much as possible. 

### Note:
The `sendMessageInvoker` method may need further adjustments based on how messages are sent in the new API, as the method signature and behavior of `plugin.sendMessage` may also have changed.
