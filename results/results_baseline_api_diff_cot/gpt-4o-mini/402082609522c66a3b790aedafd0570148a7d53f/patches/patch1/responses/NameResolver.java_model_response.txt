### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed CommandSource**: The `CommandSource` class has been removed from the API, so I replaced its type with `Object` for the `invoker` variable.
2. **Updated Constructor**: The constructor now accepts an `Object` instead of `CommandSource`.
3. **Method Adjustments**: The `sendMessageInvoker` method remains unchanged, but it may need further adjustments based on how messages are sent to the new invoker type, which is now an `Object`. This part may require additional context on how to handle the new type in the `plugin.sendMessage` method.
4. **Maintained Functionality**: The overall structure and functionality of the class are preserved while addressing the compilation errors due to the API changes.
