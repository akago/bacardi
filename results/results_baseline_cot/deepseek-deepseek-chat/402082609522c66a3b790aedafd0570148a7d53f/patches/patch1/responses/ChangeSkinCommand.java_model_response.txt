1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `CommandSpec` cannot be found.
   - The package `org.spongepowered.api.command.spec` does not exist.
   - This suggests that the `CommandSpec` class has been moved or renamed in the newer version of the SpongeAPI dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The issue is in the `ChangeSkinCommand` interface, specifically with the import statement and the use of `CommandSpec`.
   - The interface itself is simple, with a single method `buildSpec()` that returns a `CommandSpec`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `CommandSpec` class might have been moved to a different package in the newer version of SpongeAPI.
   - The fix would involve updating the import statement to reflect the new package location of `CommandSpec`.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package for `CommandSpec`.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged.

Based on the analysis, here is the fixed Java class:

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSpec;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    CommandSpec buildSpec();
}
```

The fix involves updating the import statement from `org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec` to `org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSpec`, which reflects the new package location of the `CommandSpec` class in the updated SpongeAPI dependency. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
