1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `CommandSource` and the package `org.spongepowered.api.text.serializer` cannot be found.
   - This suggests that the SpongeAPI dependency has been updated, and these classes/packages have either been moved, renamed, or removed.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the import statements and the usage of `CommandSource` and `TextSerializers`.
   - The class `SkinChanger` relies on these classes to send messages to the invoker.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `CommandSource` class might have been replaced by a different class in the newer version of SpongeAPI, such as `CommandCause` or `CommandExecutor`.
   - The `TextSerializers` class might have been moved or replaced by a different class, such as `ComponentSerializer`.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statements to use the correct classes from the newer SpongeAPI version.
   - Replace `CommandSource` with the appropriate class, such as `CommandCause`.
   - Replace `TextSerializers.LEGACY_FORMATTING_CODE.deserialize` with the appropriate method for deserializing text.

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.model.auth.Account;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedSkinChanger;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause;
import org.spongepowered.api.text.serializer.ComponentSerializer;

public class SkinChanger extends SharedSkinChanger {

    private final CommandCause invoker;

    public SkinChanger(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, Account owner, String url, String oldSkinUrl, CommandCause invoker) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), owner, url, oldSkinUrl);

        this.invoker = invoker;
    }

    @Override
    protected void sendMessageInvoker(String localeMessage) {
        invoker.sendMessage(ComponentSerializer.legacy().deserialize(localeMessage));
    }
}
```

In this fix:
- The `CommandSource` class has been replaced with `CommandCause`, which is likely the new class in the updated SpongeAPI.
- The `TextSerializers.LEGACY_FORMATTING_CODE.deserialize` method has been replaced with `ComponentSerializer.legacy().deserialize`, which is the new way to deserialize legacy formatted text in the updated SpongeAPI.
- The import statements have been updated to reflect these changes.
