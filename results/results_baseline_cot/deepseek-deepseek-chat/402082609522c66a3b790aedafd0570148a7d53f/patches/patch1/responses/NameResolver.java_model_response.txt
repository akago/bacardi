1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `CommandSource` cannot be found.
   - The errors occur on lines 8, 14, and 18 in the `NameResolver` class.
   - This suggests that the `CommandSource` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the updated version of the Sponge API.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `CommandSource` class is imported from `org.spongepowered.api.command`.
   - It is used as a parameter in the constructor and as a field in the `NameResolver` class.
   - The `sendMessageInvoker` method also uses `CommandSource` to send messages.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `CommandSource` class might have been replaced by a different class in the newer version of the Sponge API.
   - A common replacement for `CommandSource` in newer versions of Sponge is `CommandCause` or `CommandExecutor`.
   - The fix should involve updating the import statement and replacing `CommandSource` with the appropriate class.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct class from the Sponge API.
   - Replace all occurrences of `CommandSource` with the new class name.
   - Ensure that the new class provides the same functionality as `CommandSource`.

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedNameResolver;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.UUID;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause;
import org.spongepowered.api.entity.living.player.Player;

public class NameResolver extends SharedNameResolver {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandCause invoker;
    private final Player receiver;
    private final boolean keepSkin;

    public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandCause invoker, String targetName, Player receiver
            , boolean keepSkin) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), targetName, keepSkin);

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.receiver = receiver;
        this.keepSkin = keepSkin;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String id) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean hasSkinPermission(UUID uuid) {
        //todo check skin permissions
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleDownloader(UUID uuid) {
        //run this is the same thread
        new SkinDownloader(plugin, invoker, receiver, uuid, keepSkin).run();
    }
}
```

In this fix, I replaced `CommandSource` with `CommandCause`, which is a more recent class in the Sponge API that serves a similar purpose. The import statement has been updated accordingly, and all references to `CommandSource` have been changed to `CommandCause`. This should resolve the compilation errors while maintaining the intended functionality of the code.
