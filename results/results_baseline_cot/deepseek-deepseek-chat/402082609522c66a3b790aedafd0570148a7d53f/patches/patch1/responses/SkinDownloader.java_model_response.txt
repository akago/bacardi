1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `CommandSource` cannot be found in the package `org.spongepowered.api.command`.
   - The error occurs on lines 9, 16, and 19 in the `SkinDownloader` class.
   - This suggests that the `CommandSource` class has been moved, renamed, or removed in the updated version of the Sponge API dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `CommandSource` class is used in the `SkinDownloader` class as a parameter type and as a field.
   - The `sendMessageInvoker` method also uses `CommandSource` to send messages.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `CommandSource` class might have been replaced by a different class in the newer version of the Sponge API.
   - Research the Sponge API documentation to find the appropriate replacement for `CommandSource`.
   - Update the imports and class references accordingly.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace `CommandSource` with the appropriate class, such as `CommandCause` or `CommandExecutor`, depending on the Sponge API version.
   - Update the imports to reflect the new class.
   - Ensure that the new class provides the same functionality as `CommandSource`.

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.model.skin.SkinModel;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedDownloader;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.UUID;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause;
import org.spongepowered.api.entity.living.player.Player;
import org.spongepowered.api.scheduler.Task;

public class SkinDownloader extends SharedDownloader {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandCause invoker;
    private final Player receiver;

    public SkinDownloader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandCause invoker, Player receiver, UUID targetUUID
            , boolean keepSkin) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), keepSkin, targetUUID, receiver.getUniqueId());

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleApplyTask(SkinModel skinData) {
        Runnable skinUpdater = new SkinApplier(plugin, invoker, receiver, skinData, keepSkin);
        Task.builder().execute(skinUpdater).submit(plugin);
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String id) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id);
    }
}
```

In this fix, I replaced `CommandSource` with `CommandCause`, which is a common replacement in newer versions of the Sponge API. I also updated the import statement to reflect this change. This should resolve the compilation errors while maintaining the functionality of the code.
