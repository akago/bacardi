<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the package `javax.interceptor` does not exist, and the symbol `InterceptorBinding` cannot be found.
   - The issue occurs at line 5 and line 13 in the `Replaceable.java` file.
   - This suggests that the `javax.interceptor` package is either missing or has been moved/renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `@InterceptorBinding` annotation is used in the `Replaceable` annotation.
   - The import statement `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;` is causing the error because the package is not found.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `javax.interceptor` package might have been moved to a different package in the newer version of the dependency.
   - Researching the correct package for `InterceptorBinding` in the updated dependency version is necessary.
   - A common replacement for `javax.interceptor` in newer versions is `jakarta.interceptor`.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package for `InterceptorBinding`.
   - Ensure that the new import statement is compatible with the updated dependency version.
   - The rest of the code can remain unchanged as it does not directly cause any compilation or functionality errors.
