1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the method `getInstance()` cannot be found in the class `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService`.
   - The error occurs on line 18 in the `MSSQLDatabase` class.
   - This suggests that the `ExecutorService` class in the updated dependency no longer has a static `getInstance()` method.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(...)`.
   - The code is trying to access an executor instance using the `getInstance()` method, which is no longer available.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `ExecutorService` class might have been updated to use a different method to obtain an executor instance.
   - We need to find the correct way to get an executor instance in the updated dependency version.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the `getInstance()` call with the appropriate method to obtain an executor instance.
   - Ensure that the new method is compatible with the updated dependency version.

```java
package liquibase.ext.mssql.database;

import liquibase.CatalogAndSchema;
import liquibase.exception.LiquibaseException;
import liquibase.executor.ExecutorService;
import liquibase.ext.mssql.statement.DropStoredProcedureStatement;

public class MSSQLDatabase extends liquibase.database.core.MSSQLDatabase {
    
    @Override
    public int getPriority() {
        return PRIORITY_DATABASE;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void dropDatabaseObjects(CatalogAndSchema schemaToDrop) throws LiquibaseException {
        super.dropDatabaseObjects(schemaToDrop);
        ExecutorService executorService = new ExecutorService();
        executorService.getExecutor(this).execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));
    }
}
```

In this fix, I replaced the `getInstance()` call with a direct instantiation of the `ExecutorService` class. This assumes that the `ExecutorService` class can be instantiated directly in the updated dependency version. If the `ExecutorService` class requires a different approach to obtain an instance, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
