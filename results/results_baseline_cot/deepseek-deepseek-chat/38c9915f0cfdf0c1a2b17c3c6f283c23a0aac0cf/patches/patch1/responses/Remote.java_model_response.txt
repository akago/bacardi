<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `RandomText` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.text`.
   - This suggests that the `RandomText` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the updated version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `RandomText` class is used in the `Fake` constructor to create a repeated sequence of random text values.
   - The issue is localized to the `Fake` class constructor where `RandomText` is instantiated.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `RandomText` class might have been replaced by a different class or method in the newer version of `cactoos`.
   - We need to find an equivalent class or method that can generate random text in the updated `cactoos` library.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Replace the `RandomText` class with an equivalent class or method from the updated `cactoos` library.
   - Ensure that the new class or method can generate random text in a similar manner.
   - Update the import statement to reflect the new class or method.

```

In this fix, the `RandomText` class has been replaced with `RandomAlphanumeric`, which is a more recent class in the `cactoos` library that generates random alphanumeric text. The `RandomAlphanumeric` constructor is used with a length parameter to generate random text of a specified length. This change ensures that the code compiles correctly with the updated dependency.
