1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.scalar`.
   - This suggests that the `IoCheckedScalar` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the updated version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is in the `pull` method of the `RtNetwork` class, where `IoCheckedScalar` is used to wrap a `Reduced` scalar.
   - The `IoCheckedScalar` class is imported from `org.cactoos.scalar`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `IoCheckedScalar` is not found, we need to find an alternative way to handle the scalar operation, possibly using a different class or method from the updated `cactoos` library.
   - The `Reduced` class is still being used, so we need to ensure that the reduction operation is still valid.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace `IoCheckedScalar` with an alternative that provides similar functionality, such as `UncheckedScalar` or directly using the `Reduced` class.
   - Ensure that the new approach still handles the reduction and potential IO exceptions correctly.

```

In this fix, I replaced `IoCheckedScalar` with `Unchecked` from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. The `Unchecked` class provides similar functionality by wrapping a scalar and handling unchecked exceptions. This change should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the intended behavior of the `pull` method.
