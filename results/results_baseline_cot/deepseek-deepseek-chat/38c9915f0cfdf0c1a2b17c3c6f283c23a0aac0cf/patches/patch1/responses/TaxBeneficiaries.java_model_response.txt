1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `LengthOf` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.iterable`.
   - This suggests that the `LengthOf` class has either been moved to a different package or removed in the updated version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is `new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue() >= 16`.
   - The `LengthOf` class is used to calculate the length of an iterable, which is then compared to 16.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `LengthOf` class might have been moved to a different package or replaced with a different class or method in the updated version of `cactoos`.
   - A possible fix could be to replace `LengthOf` with a different method or class that provides the same functionality.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Replace `LengthOf` with an alternative method or class that can calculate the length of an iterable.
   - Ensure that the replacement is compatible with the updated version of the `cactoos` library.

In this fix, I replaced the `LengthOf` class with the `NumberOf` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package, which provides similar functionality for calculating the length of an iterable. This change should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the intended functionality of the code.
