<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found.
   - The errors occur at lines 18 and 24 in the `PublisherFactory.java` file.
   - The issue is related to the import statement `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`, which suggests that the `PublishMetadata` class might have been moved or renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the import statement and the usage of `PublishMetadata` in the `PublisherFactory` interface.
   - The `PublisherFactory` interface uses `PublishMetadata` as a type parameter for the `Publisher` class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The most likely fix is to update the import statement to reflect the new location or name of the `PublishMetadata` class in the updated dependency version.
   - Since the function signature should not be changed, the type parameter `PublishMetadata` must remain the same, but the import statement needs to be corrected.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to point to the correct package or class name for `PublishMetadata`.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase.

Based on the analysis, here is the fixed Java class:

package com.google.pubsublite.kafka.sink;

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.proto.PublishMetadata;
import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.Publisher;
import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}
```

In this fix, the import statement for `PublishMetadata` has been updated to `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.proto.PublishMetadata`, assuming that the class has been moved to the `proto` package in the updated dependency version. This change should resolve the compilation error while keeping the rest of the code intact.
