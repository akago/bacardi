1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `MavenProject` cannot be found.
   - The errors occur at lines 35, 47, and 24 in the `AbstractThemeMojo` class.
   - The package `org.apache.maven.project` does not exist, which suggests that the Maven dependency for `maven-project` is either missing or incorrect.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `MavenProject` class is used as a field type and in the `getProject()` method.
   - The import statement `import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;` is causing the issue because the package does not exist.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The issue is likely due to a missing or incorrect Maven dependency.
   - The correct package for `MavenProject` should be `org.apache.maven.api.project` in newer versions of Maven.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package for `MavenProject`.
   - Ensure that the Maven dependency for `maven-api` is included in the project's `pom.xml`.

The fix involves updating the import statement for `MavenProject` to use the correct package `org.apache.maven.api.project`. This should resolve the compilation errors related to the missing `MavenProject` class. Additionally, ensure that the Maven dependency for `maven-api` is included in the project's `pom.xml` to avoid further issues.
