<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `Storages` cannot be found in the package `com.artipie.asto.factory`.
   - The error occurs at line 9 (import statement) and line 43 (usage of `Storages` class).
   - This suggests that the `Storages` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Storages` class is used to create a new storage instance in the `getPolicy` method.
   - The code attempts to import `com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages`, which is no longer valid.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Storages` class might have been moved to a different package or replaced with a different class.
   - The fix should involve updating the import statement and the usage of the `Storages` class to match the new dependency structure.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package or class.
   - Modify the code to use the new class or method for creating storage instances.
   - Ensure the fix does not break the existing functionality.

}
```

In this fix:
- The import statement for `com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages` has been replaced with `com.artipie.asto.Storage` and `com.artipie.asto.factory.StorageFactory`.
- The `Storages` class usage has been replaced with `StorageFactory.INSTANCE.newStorage`, assuming that `StorageFactory` is the new class responsible for creating storage instances.
- The rest of the code remains unchanged to ensure that the functionality is preserved.
