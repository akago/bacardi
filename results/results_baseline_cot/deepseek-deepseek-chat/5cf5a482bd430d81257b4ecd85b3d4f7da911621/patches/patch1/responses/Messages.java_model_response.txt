1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `MvcContext` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 23 in the `Messages` class.
   - This suggests that the `MvcContext` class is either missing or has been moved/renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `MvcContext` class is imported from `javax.mvc.MvcContext`.
   - The `MvcContext` class is used to get the locale for the current request.
   - The code is part of a Jakarta MVC application, and the `MvcContext` class is a core component of the MVC specification.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been moved to a different package in the updated dependency version.
   - The correct import statement needs to be updated to reflect the new package location.
   - The functionality of the `Messages` class should remain unchanged.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement for `MvcContext` to the correct package in the newer dependency version.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain functionality.

    /**

    public final String get(final String key) {
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, mvcContext.getLocale());

        return bundle.containsKey(key) ? bundle.getString(key) : formatUnknownKey(key);
    }

    private static String formatUnknownKey(final String key) {
        return String.format("???%s???", key);
    }
}
```

The fix involves updating the import statement for `MvcContext` from `javax.mvc.MvcContext` to `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext`, reflecting the package change in the newer dependency version. This should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the functionality of the `Messages` class.
