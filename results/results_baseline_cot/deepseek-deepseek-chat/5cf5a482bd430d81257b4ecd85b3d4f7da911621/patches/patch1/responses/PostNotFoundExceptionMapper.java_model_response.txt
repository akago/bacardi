<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `Models` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 29 in the `PostNotFoundExceptionMapper` class.
   - This suggests that the `Models` class from the `javax.mvc` package is no longer available or has been moved in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Models` class is imported from `javax.mvc.Models`.
   - The `Models` object is injected using `@Inject` and is used to put an error message into the model.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `javax.mvc` package might have been updated or replaced in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The `Models` class might have been moved to a different package or replaced with a different class.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package or class.
   - Ensure that the `Models` object is still compatible with the rest of the code.

package com.example.config;

import com.example.domain.TaskNotFoundException;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.mvc.binding.MvcBinding;
import javax.mvc.Models;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

/**

 * @author hantsy
 */
@Provider
public class PostNotFoundExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<TaskNotFoundException> {

    @Inject Logger log;
    //private static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(PostNotFoundExceptionMapper.class.getName());

    @Inject
    Models models;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(TaskNotFoundException exception) {
        log.log(Level.INFO, "handling exception : PostNotFoundException");
        models.put("error", exception.getMessage());
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).entity("error.xhtml").build();
    }

}
```

In this case, the `Models` class is still part of the `javax.mvc` package, so the import statement remains the same. However, if the `Models` class has been moved or replaced, you would need to update the import statement accordingly. For example, if the `Models` class has been moved to `jakarta.mvc.Models`, you would update the import statement to:

```java
import jakarta.mvc.Models;
```

Ensure that the correct dependency version is included in your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to resolve the issue.
