<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `MvcContext` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 23 in the `Messages` class.
   - This suggests that the import statement for `MvcContext` is incorrect or the class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the import statement for `javax.mvc.MvcContext`.
   - The `MvcContext` class is used in the `Messages` class to get the locale for the current request.
   - The code is part of a Jakarta MVC application, and the `MvcContext` class might have been moved to a different package in the newer version of the Jakarta MVC specification.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The most likely fix is to update the import statement to reflect the new package location of the `MvcContext` class.
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been moved to the `jakarta.mvc` package in the newer versions of the Jakarta MVC specification.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement for `MvcContext` from `javax.mvc.MvcContext` to `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext`.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged, as the functionality of the `Messages` class should not be affected by this change.
