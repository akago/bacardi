<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The errors indicate that the classes `MvcContext`, `Controller`, and `Models` from the `javax.mvc` package cannot be found.
   - This suggests that the `javax.mvc` package is either missing or has been replaced/renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the imports and the usage of `MvcContext`, `Controller`, and `Models`.
   - The code is using the `javax.mvc` package, which might have been updated to a different package in the newer version of the dependency.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `javax.mvc` package has likely been moved to `jakarta.mvc` in the newer versions of the Jakarta EE specifications.
   - The fix would involve updating the imports to use the `jakarta.mvc` package instead of `javax.mvc`.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the imports from `javax.mvc` to `jakarta.mvc`.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged, as the functionality should be the same, just with updated package names.
