1. Examine the error message:
   - The first error indicates that the variable `PEER_ADDRESS` cannot be found, which suggests that this variable is not defined in the class.
   - The second error indicates that the constructor `SslFilter(SSLContext, boolean)` is not available in the updated version of the `SslFilter` class, which means the constructor signature has changed.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `PEER_ADDRESS` variable is used in the `onPreAdd` method but is not defined anywhere in the class.
   - The constructor `SSLFilter(SSLContext, boolean)` is called in the client code, but it seems this constructor is no longer available in the updated version of the `SslFilter` class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Define the `PEER_ADDRESS` variable as a static final String in the class.
   - Remove the constructor `SSLFilter(SSLContext, boolean)` and ensure the other constructor is used correctly.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Add a static final String `PEER_ADDRESS` to the class.
   - Remove the constructor `SSLFilter(SSLContext, boolean)` and ensure the other constructor is used correctly.

        if (useSNI) {
            IoSession session = parent.getSession();
            SocketAddress remoteAddress = session.getRemoteAddress();

            if (remoteAddress instanceof InetSocketAddress) {
                // activate the SNI support in the JSSE SSLEngine
                log.info("Activating TLS SNI support for peer address: {}", remoteAddress);
                session.setAttribute(PEER_ADDRESS, remoteAddress);
            }
        }

        super.onPreAdd(parent, name, nextFilter);
    }

    public void setUseSNI(boolean useSNI) {
        this.useSNI = useSNI;
    }
}
```

This fix addresses the issues by defining the `PEER_ADDRESS` constant and removing the constructor that is no longer supported by the updated dependency.
