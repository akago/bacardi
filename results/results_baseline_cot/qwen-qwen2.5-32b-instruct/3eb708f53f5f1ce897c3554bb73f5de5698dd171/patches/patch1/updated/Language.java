1. The error messages indicate that the `LanguagesResource` class from the `com.google.api.services.translate.model` package is missing, which suggests a change in the external dependency.
2. The `LanguagesResource` class is likely no longer available or has been moved to a different package in the newer version of the dependency.
3. The client code needs to be updated to use the new class or package that replaces `LanguagesResource`.
4. The fix should not change the function signatures but may require adjusting imports and method calls to match the new API.
5. The minimal changes will involve updating the import statements and the method calls to use the new class or package.
6. The changes should not affect the functionality of the class and should ensure that the class remains compilable.
7. Additional imports may be needed if the new class or package is in a different location.
