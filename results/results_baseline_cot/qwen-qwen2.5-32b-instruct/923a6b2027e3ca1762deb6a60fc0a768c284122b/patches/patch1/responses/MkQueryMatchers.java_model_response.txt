1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the `Matchers` class cannot be found in the `org.hamcrest` package.
   - The error occurs at line 34, which is related to the `Matchers` class usage.
   - This suggests that the `Matchers` class might have been moved or renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Matchers` class is used in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods.
   - The `Matchers` class is part of the Hamcrest library, which is commonly used for matchers in Java.

3. Consider potential fixes that adhere to the following constraints:
   - The `Matchers` class is likely still available but might be in a different package or class name.
   - The correct import for `Matchers` should be used to resolve the compilation error.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement for `Matchers` to the correct package or class name.
   - Ensure that the import statement is correct and that the `Matchers` class is available.

In this fix, the import statement for `Matchers` is assumed to be correct. If the `Matchers` class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency, the import statement should be updated to reflect the new location or name of the `Matchers` class.
