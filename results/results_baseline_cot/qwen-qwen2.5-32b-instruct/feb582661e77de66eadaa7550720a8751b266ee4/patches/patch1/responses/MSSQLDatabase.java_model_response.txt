1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the `getInstance()` method cannot be found in the `ExecutorService` class.
   - The error occurs at line 18, where `ExecutorService.getInstance()` is called.
   - This suggests that the `ExecutorService` class in the updated dependency no longer has the `getInstance()` method.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));`.
   - The `ExecutorService` class is used to get an instance of an executor, which is then used to execute a `DropStoredProcedureStatement`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `getInstance()` method is no longer available, so we need to find an alternative way to obtain an instance of `ExecutorService`.
   - If the new version of the dependency provides a different way to get an instance of `ExecutorService`, we should use that method.
   - If the `ExecutorService` is now a singleton and can be accessed directly, we should adjust the code accordingly.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Check the documentation or source code of the updated dependency to find the new method or way to get an instance of `ExecutorService`.
   - Modify the code to use the new method or access the singleton instance directly.

```java
package liquibase.ext.mssql.database;

import liquibase.CatalogAndSchema;
import liquibase.exception.LiquibaseException;
import liquibase.executor.Executor;
import liquibase.ext.mssql.statement.DropStoredProcedureStatement;

public class MSSQLDatabase extends liquibase.database.core.MSSQLDatabase {
    
    @Override
    public int getPriority() {
        return PRIORITY_DATABASE;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void dropDatabaseObjects(CatalogAndSchema schemaToDrop) throws LiquibaseException {
        super.dropDatabaseObjects(schemaToDrop);
        Executor executor = ExecutorService.getExecutor(this);
        executor.execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));
    }
}
```

In this fix, I've assumed that the `ExecutorService` class no longer has a static `getInstance()` method and that the `getExecutor` method can be called directly on the `ExecutorService` class. If the actual change in the dependency is different, the fix would need to be adjusted accordingly.
