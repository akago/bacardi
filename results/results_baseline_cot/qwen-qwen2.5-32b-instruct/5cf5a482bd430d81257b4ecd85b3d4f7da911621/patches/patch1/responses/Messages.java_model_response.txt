1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `MvcContext` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 23, which is where `MvcContext` is referenced.
   - This suggests that the `MvcContext` class is no longer available in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `MvcContext` class is used to get the locale of the current request.
   - The `MvcContext` class is injected into the `Messages` class.
   - The `MvcContext` class is used in the `get` method to retrieve the correct locale for the resource bundle.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `MvcContext` class is likely part of a dependency that has been updated or removed.
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been replaced by another class or method in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been moved to a different package.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Identify the replacement for `MvcContext` in the updated dependency.
   - Replace the usage of `MvcContext` with the new class or method.
   - Ensure that the new class or method is correctly imported.

To fix the issue, we need to find the replacement for `MvcContext` in the updated dependency. Assuming the new dependency provides a similar class or method to get the locale, we will replace `MvcContext` with the new class or method. For this example, let's assume the new class is `RequestContext` and it has a method `getLocale()` that returns the locale of the current request.

```java
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;
import javax.mvc.RequestContext; // Assuming the new class is RequestContext

/**
 * Provides I18n messages for the UI per request. To get the correct locale, the method {@link RequestContext#getLocale()}
 * is used.
 *
 * @author Tobias Erdle
 * @see RequestContext#getLocale()
 */
@RequestScoped
@Named("msg")
public class Messages {

    private static final String BASE_NAME = "messages";

    @Inject
    private RequestContext requestContext; // Inject the new class

    /**
     * Get the assigned message to some key based on the {@link java.util.Locale} of the current request.
     *
     * @param key the message key to use
     * @return the correct translation assigned to the key for the request locale, a fallback translation or a
     * placeholder for unknown keys.
     */
    public final String get(final String key) {
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, requestContext.getLocale()); // Use the new class

        return bundle.containsKey(key) ? bundle.getString(key) : formatUnknownKey(key);
    }

    private static String formatUnknownKey(final String key) {
        return String.format("???%s???", key);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MvcContext` class has been replaced with `RequestContext`, and the `@Inject` annotation now injects an instance of `RequestContext`. The `get` method now uses `requestContext.getLocale()` to get the locale of the current request. This change assumes that `RequestContext` is the correct replacement for `MvcContext` in the updated dependency. If the actual replacement class or method is different, it should be used instead.
