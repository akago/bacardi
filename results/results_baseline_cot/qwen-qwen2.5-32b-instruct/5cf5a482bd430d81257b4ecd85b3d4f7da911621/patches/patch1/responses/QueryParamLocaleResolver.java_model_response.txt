1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that the `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext` classes, as well as the `javax.mvc.locale` package, cannot be found. This suggests that the dependency related to these classes has been updated or removed in the newer version of the library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the imports and the implementation of the `LocaleResolver` interface.
   - The `LocaleResolverContext` class is used in the `resolveLocale` method.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `javax.mvc.locale` package and its classes are not available, which suggests that the dependency might have been updated to a newer version where these classes have been moved or renamed.
   - The `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext` classes might have been moved to a different package or namespace in the newer version of the dependency.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statements to reflect the new location of the `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext` classes.
   - Remove the `@Override` annotation if the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
   - Ensure that the class and method signatures remain unchanged.

}
```

In this fix, the import statements have been updated to reflect the new package names (`jakarta.mvc.locale` instead of `javax.mvc.locale` and `jakarta.ws.rs.core` instead of `javax.ws.rs.core`). The `@Override` annotation has been removed from the `resolveLocale` method as the method signature no longer overrides a method from the updated dependency.
