<code_analysis>
The error messages indicate that several classes and annotations from the `javax.mvc` package and related packages are not found. This suggests that the dependency update has likely moved or removed these classes. The `javax.mvc` package is part of the MVC specification, and it seems that the newer version of the dependency might have changed the package structure or removed some of these classes.

To address this, we need to:
1. Identify the new location of the missing classes or determine if they are no longer supported.
2. Update the imports to reflect the new package structure or remove the usage of the missing classes if they are no longer available.
3. Ensure that the code remains functional and compilable after the changes.

Given the context, it seems that the `javax.mvc` package and related annotations have been deprecated or moved. We will need to remove or replace the usage of these annotations and classes.

```java
package com.example.web;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank;
import javax.ws.rs.FormParam;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

/**

@Path("greeting")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetingController {

    @Inject
    private BindingResult bindingResult;

    @Inject
    private Models models;

    @Inject
    private AlertMessage flashMessage;

    @Inject
    private Logger log;

    @GET
    public String get() {
        return "greeting.xhtml";
    }

    @POST
    public String post(
            @FormParam("greeting")
            @NotBlank String greeting) {
        if (bindingResult.isFailed()) {
            AlertMessage alert = AlertMessage.danger("Validation voilations!");
            bindingResult.getAllErrors()
                    .stream()
                    .forEach((ParamError t) -> {
                        alert.addError(t.getParamName(), "", t.getMessage());
                    });
            models.put("errors", alert);
            log.info("mvc binding failed.");
            return "greeting.xhtml";
        }

        log.info("redirect to greeting page.");
        flashMessage.notify(AlertMessage.Type.success, "Message:" + greeting);
        return "redirect:greeting";
    }

    // Assuming BindingResult, Models, and ParamError are custom classes or interfaces
    // that are part of the application's internal logic and are not part of the removed dependency.
    // If they are part of the removed dependency, they would need to be replaced or implemented.
}
```

In this solution, I have removed the `@Controller` and `@UriRef` annotations, as well as the `@MvcBinding` annotation, since they are not part of the standard Java EE or Jakarta EE packages and are likely part of a removed or deprecated MVC framework. The `BindingResult`, `Models`, and `ParamError` classes are assumed to be part of the application's internal logic and are not part of the removed dependency. If they are part of the removed dependency, they would need to be replaced or implemented according to the new dependency structure.
