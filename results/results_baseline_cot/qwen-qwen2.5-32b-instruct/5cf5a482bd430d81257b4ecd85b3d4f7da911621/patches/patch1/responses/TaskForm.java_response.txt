 1. The error indicates that the `MvcBinding` class cannot be found, which suggests that the `javax.mvc.binding` package is no longer available or has been renamed in the newer version of the dependency.
 2. The `MvcBinding` annotation is likely no longer part of the newer version of the dependency, and there may be a replacement or the annotation might have been removed entirely.
 3. The client code needs to be updated to remove or replace the `@MvcBinding` annotation.
 4. The fix should not change the function signatures and should only address the compilation errors.
 5. The minimal set of changes needed is to remove the `@MvcBinding` annotations since they are causing the compilation errors.
 6. Removing the `@MvcBinding` annotations should not have side effects on the rest of the code, as it is only used for binding in the MVC context.
 7. The class should remain fully compilable after the removal of the `@MvcBinding` annotations.
 8. No additional imports are needed for this fix.
