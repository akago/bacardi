1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the method `getWildcard()` cannot be found in the class `TestListResolver`.
   - The error occurs at line 25, column 97 in the `SourceFolderFinder.java` file.
   - This suggests that the method `getWildcard()` has been removed or renamed in the updated version of the `maven-surefire` dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is `TestListResolver.getWildcard()`, which is used to get a wildcard pattern for scanning directories.
   - The `DirectoryScanner` class is used to scan directories based on the wildcard pattern.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `getWildcard()` is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to get the wildcard pattern.
   - The `DirectoryScanner` class might have a default wildcard pattern or an alternative method to set the pattern.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the call to `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` with a default wildcard pattern or a method that provides the same functionality.
   - Ensure that the `DirectoryScanner` is still used correctly and that the code remains functional.

```java
package fr.spoonlabs.flacoco.core.test.strategies.classloader.finder.classes.impl;

import fr.spoonlabs.flacoco.core.test.strategies.classloader.finder.classes.ClassFinder;
import org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.List;

public class SourceFolderFinder implements ClassFinder {

    private String srcFolder;

    public SourceFolderFinder(String srcFolder) {
        this.srcFolder = srcFolder;
    }

    @Override
    public String[] getClasses() {
        return getClassesLoc(new File(srcFolder)).toArray(new String[0]);
    }

    static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        // Assuming the default wildcard pattern is "**/*.java" for scanning Java source files.
        // This pattern should be adjusted based on the actual requirement or the new API provided by the updated dependency.
        String wildcardPattern = "**/*.java";
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, wildcardPattern);
        return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
    }
}
```

In this fix, I've replaced the call to `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` with a hardcoded wildcard pattern `"**/*.java"`, which is a common pattern for scanning Java source files. This assumes that the `DirectoryScanner` class can accept a wildcard pattern directly. If the `DirectoryScanner` class or the `maven-surefire` library has a different method or pattern for scanning, this should be adjusted accordingly.
