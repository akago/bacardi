The error messages indicate that the classes and packages related to `javax.mvc.locale` are not found, which suggests that the dependency related to this package has been updated or removed. The `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` classes are not available in the current environment, likely due to a change in the dependency version.

Given the context, it seems that the `javax.mvc` package has been replaced or deprecated in favor of a new package or version. To resolve the issue, we need to identify the correct package or class that replaces the old ones and update the imports and class references accordingly.

Since the `javax.mvc` package is not found, we need to find the equivalent classes in the new version of the dependency. Assuming the new version uses the `jakarta.mvc` package (as is common in recent updates from Java EE to Jakarta EE), we can update the imports and class references to use the new package.

The following changes are proposed:
- Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver`.
- Replace `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` with `jakarta.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext`.
- Ensure the correct imports are used for the new package.

public class QueryParamLocaleResolver implements LocaleResolver {
    
    @Inject
    Logger log;
    
    @Override
    public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context) {
        final String queryLang = context.getUriInfo()
                .getQueryParameters()
                .getFirst("lang");
        log.log(Level.INFO, "QueryParamLocaleResolver::resolveLocale:lang:{0}", queryLang);
        return queryLang != null ? Locale.forLanguageTag(queryLang) : null;
    }
}
```

This solution assumes that the `javax.mvc` package has been replaced by `jakarta.mvc` in the updated dependency. If the actual replacement package is different, the imports and class references should be updated accordingly.
