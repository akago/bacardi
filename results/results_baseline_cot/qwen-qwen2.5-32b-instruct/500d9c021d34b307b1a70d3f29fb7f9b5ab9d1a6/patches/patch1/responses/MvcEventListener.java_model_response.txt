<code_analysis>
The error messages indicate that the `javax.mvc.event` package and its related classes are not found. This suggests that the dependency related to the `javax.mvc.event` package has been updated or removed, and the new version of the dependency might have a different package structure or class names.

Given the context of the error, it seems that the `javax.mvc.event` package is no longer available in the updated dependency. The classes `BeforeControllerEvent`, `BeforeProcessViewEvent`, `AfterControllerEvent`, `AfterProcessViewEvent`, and `ControllerRedirectEvent` are not found, which implies that these classes might have been moved to a different package or renamed in the newer version of the dependency.

To resolve this issue, we need to identify the new package or class names in the updated dependency and update the imports accordingly. If the classes have been moved to a different package, we need to update the import statements. If the classes have been renamed, we need to update the class names in the code.

Since the exact new package or class names are not provided, I will assume that the classes have been moved to the `jakarta.mvc.event` package, which is a common change when moving from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

Here is the proposed fix based on this assumption:

```java
package com.example;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.mvc.event.AfterControllerEvent;
import jakarta.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent;
import jakarta.mvc.event.BeforeControllerEvent;
import jakarta.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent;
import jakarta.mvc.event.ControllerRedirectEvent;

@ApplicationScoped
public class MvcEventListener {

    @Inject
    Logger LOGGER;

    private void onControllerMatched(@Observes BeforeControllerEvent event) {
        LOGGER.info(() -> "Controller matched for " + event.getUriInfo().getRequestUri());
    }

    private void onViewEngineSelected(@Observes BeforeProcessViewEvent event) {
        LOGGER.info(() -> "View engine: " + event.getEngine());
    }

    private void onAfterControllerEvent(@Observes AfterControllerEvent event) {
        LOGGER.info(() -> "AfterControllerEvent:: " + event.getResourceInfo());
    }

    private void onAfterProcessViewEvent(@Observes AfterProcessViewEvent event) {
        LOGGER.info(() -> "AfterProcessViewEvent:: " + event);
    }
    
    private void onControllerRedirectEvent(@Observes ControllerRedirectEvent event) {
        LOGGER.info(() -> "ControllerRedirectEvent:: " + event);
    }

    @PostConstruct
    private void init() {
        LOGGER.config(() -> this.getClass().getSimpleName() + " created");
    }
}
```

This fix assumes that the `javax.mvc.event` package has been renamed to `jakarta.mvc.event`. If the actual package or class names are different, the import statements and class references should be updated accordingly.
