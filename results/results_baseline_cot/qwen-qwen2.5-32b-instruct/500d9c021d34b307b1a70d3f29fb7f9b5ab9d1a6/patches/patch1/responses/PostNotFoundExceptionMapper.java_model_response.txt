1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the `Models` class cannot be found, which suggests that the `Models` class is no longer available in the updated dependency.
   - The error occurs at line 29, where the `Models` class is referenced.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Models` class is used to store the error message in the model, which is then presumably used in the view.
   - The `Models` class is injected via the `@Inject` annotation, indicating it is part of the dependency injection framework used in the project.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since the `Models` class is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to store the error message.
   - One possible solution is to use a different mechanism to pass the error message to the view, such as using a request attribute or a session attribute.
   - Alternatively, if the `Models` class is part of a specific framework, we need to find the equivalent class or method in the updated version of the framework.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Remove the `Models` class and its usage.
   - Replace the `models.put("error", exception.getMessage());` line with a different method to store the error message, such as using a request attribute.
   - Ensure that the rest of the class remains functional and that the error message is still accessible to the view.

```java
package com.example.config;

import com.example.domain.TaskNotFoundException;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

@Provider
public class PostNotFoundExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<TaskNotFoundException> {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Context
    HttpServletRequest request;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(TaskNotFoundException exception) {
        log.log(Level.INFO, "handling exception : PostNotFoundException");
        // Use request attribute to store the error message
        request.setAttribute("error", exception.getMessage());
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).entity("error.xhtml").build();
    }
}
```

In this solution, the `Models` class is removed, and the error message is stored in a request attribute instead. This approach assumes that the view can access the request attributes to display the error message. If the view layer is not compatible with this change, further adjustments may be necessary to ensure the error message is correctly displayed.
