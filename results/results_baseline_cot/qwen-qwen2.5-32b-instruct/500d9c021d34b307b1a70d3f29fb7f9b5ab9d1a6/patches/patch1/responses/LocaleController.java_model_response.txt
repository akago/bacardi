The error messages indicate that the classes `MvcContext`, `Models`, and `Controller` from the `javax.mvc` package cannot be found. This suggests that the dependency related to the `javax.mvc` package has been updated or removed, and the new version does not include these classes. The `javax.mvc` package is part of the Java MVC (Model-View-Controller) specification, which has been superseded by the Jakarta EE specification. Therefore, the `javax.mvc` package has been replaced by the `jakarta.mvc` package in the newer versions of Jakarta EE.

To resolve the issue, the imports and annotations need to be updated to use the `jakarta.mvc` package instead of `javax.mvc`. Additionally, the `MvcContext` and `Models` classes need to be replaced with their equivalents in the new package, if they exist. If the exact equivalents do not exist, the code might need to be refactored to use the new APIs provided by Jakarta EE.

Given the constraints, the fix will involve updating the imports and annotations to use the `jakarta.mvc` package.

```java
package com.example.web;

import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.mvc.annotation.Controller;
import jakarta.mvc.Models;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

/**

@Path("locale")
@Controller
@RequestScoped
public class LocaleController {

    @Inject
    Models models;

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @GET
    public String get() {
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault(); // Assuming MvcContext.getLocale() is replaced with Locale.getDefault()
        models.put("locale", locale);
        return "locale.xhtml";
    }

}
```

In this fix, the `javax.mvc` package has been replaced with `jakarta.mvc` and the `MvcContext` class has been removed since it is not directly available in the new package. Instead, `Locale.getDefault()` is used as a placeholder for the locale retrieval, which may need to be adjusted based on the actual requirements and the new APIs provided by Jakarta EE.
