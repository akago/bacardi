1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `Member` class cannot be found in the `com.hazelcast.core` package.
   - The errors occur at lines 24 and 41, where the `Member` class is referenced.
   - This suggests that the `Member` class has been removed or moved in the updated version of the Hazelcast dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Member` class is used in the constructor and in the initialization of the `hostname` and `nodeID` fields.
   - The `Member` class is also referenced in the constructor parameter.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Member` class might have been replaced by another class in the newer version of Hazelcast.
   - The `Member` class could have been moved to a different package.
   - The `Member` class might have been renamed.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Identify the replacement or equivalent class in the new Hazelcast version.
   - Update the import statement to reflect the new location or name of the class.
   - Modify the constructor and the fields that use the `Member` class to use the new class.

To fix the issue, we need to update the code to use the new class that replaces `Member`. Assuming the new class is `ClusterMember` and it is located in the same package, the following patch can be applied:

```java
package org.jivesoftware.openfire.plugin.util.cluster;

import org.jivesoftware.openfire.cluster.ClusterManager;
import org.jivesoftware.openfire.cluster.ClusterNodeInfo;
import org.jivesoftware.openfire.cluster.NodeID;
import org.jivesoftware.openfire.plugin.util.cache.ClusteredCacheFactory;

import com.hazelcast.core.ClusterMember; // Assuming the new class name is ClusterMember

/**
 * Cluster Node information as provided by Hazelcast.
 *
 * @author Tom Evans
 * @author Gaston Dombiak
 */
public class HazelcastClusterNodeInfo implements ClusterNodeInfo {

    public static final String HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE = "hostname";
    public static final String NODE_ID_ATTRIBUTE = "node-id";
    private final String hostname;
    private final NodeID nodeID;
    private final long joinedTime;
    private final boolean seniorMember;

    public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final ClusterMember member, final long joinedTime) { // Use ClusterMember instead of Member
        this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";
        this.nodeID = ClusteredCacheFactory.getNodeID(member);
        this.joinedTime = joinedTime;
        this.seniorMember = ClusterManager.getSeniorClusterMember().equals(nodeID);
    }

    public String getHostName() {
        return hostname;
    }

    public NodeID getNodeID() {
        return nodeID;
    }

    public long getJoinedTime() {
        return joinedTime;
    }

    public boolean isSeniorMember() {
        return seniorMember;
    }
}
```

In this patch, the `Member` class is replaced with `ClusterMember`, assuming that `ClusterMember` is the new class name in the updated Hazelcast version. The import statement and the constructor parameter type are updated accordingly. If the actual class name or package has changed differently, the import and class name should be adjusted to match the new Hazelcast version.
