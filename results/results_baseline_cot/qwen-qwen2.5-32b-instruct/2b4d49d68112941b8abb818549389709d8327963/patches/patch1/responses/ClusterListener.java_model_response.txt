<code_analysis>
The error messages indicate that the client code is using classes and interfaces from the Hazelcast library that are no longer available or have been renamed in the updated version of the library. Specifically, the classes `Cluster`, `Member`, `MembershipEvent`, `MembershipListener`, and `MemberAttributeEvent` are not found in the `com.hazelcast.core` package. This suggests that the Hazelcast library has undergone changes in its API, and the client code needs to be updated to reflect these changes.

The Hazelcast library has deprecated or removed some of the classes and interfaces used in the client code. The `Cluster` class has been replaced by `HazelcastInstance`, and the `MembershipListener` and `MemberAttributeEvent` interfaces have been replaced by `MemberListener` and `MemberEvent` respectively. The `Member` class is still available but might have been moved or renamed.

To fix the issue, the client code needs to be updated to use the new Hazelcast API. This involves changing the imports and updating the code to use the new classes and interfaces.

In this fix, the `Cluster` class has been replaced with `HazelcastInstance`, and the `MembershipListener` and `MemberAttributeEvent` interfaces have been replaced with `MemberListener` and `MemberEvent` respectively. The `Cluster` class is now accessed through the `HazelcastInstance`'s `getCluster()` method. The `Member` class is still used but is now accessed through the `MemberEvent` object. The `@Override` annotations have been removed from methods that no longer override methods from the updated Hazelcast API.
