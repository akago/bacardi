1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `RandomText` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.text`.
   - This suggests that the `RandomText` class has been removed or moved in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `RandomText` class is used in the `Fake` constructor to initialize the `score` field.
   - The `RandomText` class is not used anywhere else in the provided code.

3. Consider potential fixes that adhere to the following constraints:
   - Since `RandomText` is not found, we need to find an alternative way to initialize the `score` field.
   - We can replace `RandomText` with another class or method that provides similar functionality.
   - Ensure that the replacement does not change the behavior of the `Fake` class significantly.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Replace `RandomText` with a different class or method that can generate a random text or string.
   - Ensure that the replacement class or method is available in the current dependency version.

        private final Score score;

        /**

         * @param val The remote's score value
         */
        public Fake(final int val) {
            this(new RtScore(
                new Repeated<>(val, new Joined("random"))
            ));
        }

        /**
         * Ctor.
         * @param score The remote's score
         */
        public Fake(final Score score) {
            this.score = score;
        }

        @Override
        public Score score() {
            return this.score;
        }

        @Override
        public void push(final Wallet wallet) {
            // nothing
        }

        @Override
        public Wallet pull(final long id) {
            return new Wallet.Fake(id);
        }
    }
}
```

In this fix, `RandomText` is replaced with `Joined("random")` to generate a string that can be used in the `Repeated` constructor. This change ensures that the `Fake` class can still initialize the `score` field without relying on the missing `RandomText` class.
