1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `LengthOf` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.iterable`.
   - The error occurs at line 27, where `LengthOf` is used to calculate the length of the `Iterable<Text>`.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `compareTo` method uses `LengthOf` to compare the lengths of the suffixes of two `Score` objects.
   - The `LengthOf` class is not found, which suggests that it might have been removed or renamed in the updated dependency.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `LengthOf` is not available, we need to find an alternative way to calculate the length of the `Iterable<Text>`.
   - We can use Java Streams to calculate the length of the iterable.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the usage of `LengthOf` with a stream-based approach to count the elements in the iterable.
   - Ensure that the `compareTo` method still functions correctly after the change.

```java
package io.zold.api;

import org.cactoos.Text;
import org.cactoos.iterable.IterableOf;

import java.util.stream.Collectors;

/**
 * Default implementation for {@link Score}.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 */
public final class RtScore implements Score {

    /**
     * The suffixes.
     */
    private final Iterable<Text> sfxs;

    /**
     * Ctor.
     *
     * @param sfxs The suffixes.
     */
    RtScore(final Iterable<Text> sfxs) {
        this.sfxs = sfxs;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(final Score other) {
        return (int) other.suffixes().stream().count()
            - (int) this.sfxs.stream().count();
    }

    @Override
    public Iterable<Text> suffixes() {
        return this.sfxs;
    }
}
```

In this solution, the `LengthOf` class is replaced with a stream-based approach to count the elements in the iterable. This ensures that the `compareTo` method can still compare the lengths of the suffixes without relying on the now missing `LengthOf` class.
