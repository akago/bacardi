1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.scalar`.
   - This suggests that the class `IoCheckedScalar` has been removed or moved in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is in the `pull` method where `IoCheckedScalar` is used.
   - The `IoCheckedScalar` class is used to handle an `IOException` that might be thrown during the execution of the `Reduced` operation.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `IoCheckedScalar` is not available, we need to find an alternative way to handle the `IOException`.
   - We can use a try-catch block to handle the exception directly within the `pull` method.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` with a try-catch block to handle the `IOException`.
   - Ensure that the `IOException` is properly handled and the method signature remains unchanged.

    private final Iterable<Remote> nodes;

        this.nodes.forEach(
            remote -> remote.push(wallet)
        );
    }

    @Override
    public Wallet pull(final long id) throws IOException {
        try {
            return new Reduced<>(
                Wallet::merge,
                new Mapped<>(
                    c -> c::wallet,
                    new Sorted<>(new Copies(id, this))
                )
            ).value();
        } catch (final Exception ex) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to pull wallet", ex);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Remote> iterator() {
        return this.nodes.iterator();
    }
}
```

This solution replaces the use of `IoCheckedScalar` with a try-catch block to handle the `IOException` directly within the `pull` method. This approach ensures that the method signature remains unchanged and the exception is properly handled.
