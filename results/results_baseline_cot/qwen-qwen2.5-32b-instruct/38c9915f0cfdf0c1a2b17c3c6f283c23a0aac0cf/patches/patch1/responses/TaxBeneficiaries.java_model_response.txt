1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `LengthOf` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.iterable`.
   - The error occurs at line 29, where `LengthOf` is used to check the length of the suffixes of the score of a `Remote` object.
   - This suggests that the `LengthOf` class has been removed or renamed in the updated version of the `org.cactoos` dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the instantiation of `LengthOf` to check the length of the suffixes of the score of a `Remote` object.
   - The `LengthOf` class is used to determine if the length of the suffixes is greater than or equal to 16.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `LengthOf` is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to check the length of the suffixes.
   - We can directly use the `size()` method of the `suffixes` collection to check its length.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the usage of `LengthOf` with a direct call to the `size()` method of the `suffixes` collection.
   - Ensure that the rest of the class remains unchanged to maintain its original functionality.

```java
package io.zold.api;

import java.util.Comparator;
import org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered;
import org.cactoos.iterable.IterableEnvelope;
import org.cactoos.iterable.Sorted;

/**
 * {@link Remote} nodes that should receive taxes.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 */
public final class TaxBeneficiaries extends IterableEnvelope<Remote> {

    /**
     * Ctor.
     *
     * @param nodes Remote nodes to select from.
     */
    public TaxBeneficiaries(final Iterable<Remote> nodes) {
        super(() -> new Sorted<>(
            Comparator.comparing(Remote::score),
            new Filtered<>(
                // @checkstyle MagicNumberCheck (1 line)
                n -> n.score().suffixes().size() >= 16,
                nodes
            )
        ));
    }
}
```

This fix replaces the usage of the `LengthOf` class with a direct call to the `size()` method of the `suffixes` collection, which should resolve the compilation error caused by the dependency update.
