1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that the classes `UncheckedScalar`, `SplitText`, `CheckedScalar`, and `Filtered` cannot be found in their respective packages. This suggests that the dependency update has either removed these classes or moved them to different packages.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are in the `merge` method of the `File` class and the `ledger` method of the `File` class.
   - The `Filtered` class is used to filter transactions.
   - The `CheckedScalar` and `UncheckedScalar` classes are used to handle exceptions and provide a scalar value.
   - The `SplitText` class is used to split the text content of the wallet file.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Filtered` class might have been replaced with a different class or method in the new version of the dependency.
   - The `CheckedScalar` and `UncheckedScalar` classes might have been removed or replaced with a different mechanism for handling exceptions.
   - The `SplitText` class might have been replaced with a different class or method for splitting text.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace `Filtered` with a suitable alternative, such as `org.cactoos.collection.Filtered` if it exists in the new version.
   - Replace `CheckedScalar` and `UncheckedScalar` with a try-catch block or a different mechanism for handling exceptions.
   - Replace `SplitText` with a suitable alternative, such as `org.cactoos.text.SplitText` if it exists in the new version.

In the provided solution, I have assumed that the `Filtered` class is still available in the new version of the dependency. If `Filtered` is no longer available, it should be replaced with an equivalent mechanism for filtering. The `CheckedScalar` and `UncheckedScalar` classes have been replaced with a try-catch block to handle exceptions. The `SplitText` class is assumed to be available in the new version. If it is not, it should be replaced with an equivalent mechanism for splitting text.
