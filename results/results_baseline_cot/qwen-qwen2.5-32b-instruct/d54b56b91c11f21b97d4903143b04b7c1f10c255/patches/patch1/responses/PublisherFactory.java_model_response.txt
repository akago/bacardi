1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found, which suggests that the class `PublishMetadata` might have been removed or moved in the updated dependency version.
   - The error occurs in the `PublisherFactory` interface definition.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `PublisherFactory` interface uses `PublishMetadata` as a type parameter for the `Publisher` class.
   - The `PublishMetadata` class is imported from `com.google.cloud.pubsublite`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `PublishMetadata` cannot be found, it is likely that the class has been removed or renamed in the updated dependency.
   - The fix should involve replacing `PublishMetadata` with the correct type that should be used in the updated dependency version.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace `PublishMetadata` with a type that is compatible with the updated dependency version.
   - If the type is no longer available, consider using a generic type or a different type that serves the same purpose.

```java
package com.google.pubsublite.kafka.sink;

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.Publisher;
import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<Void> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}
```

In this fix, `PublishMetadata` is replaced with `Void` as a placeholder. This is a temporary solution to resolve the compilation error. The actual type should be determined based on the updated dependency documentation or by consulting the library's changelog to find the correct replacement for `PublishMetadata`.
