The error messages indicate that several classes and interfaces that the `RedisGraphPipeline` interface extends are not found. This suggests that the Jedis dependency has been updated, and some of the interfaces that were previously available are no longer present or have been renamed or moved. The missing classes are `MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline`, `BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `BasicRedisPipeline`, `MultiKeyCommandsPipeline`, `ScriptingCommandsPipeline`, `RedisPipeline`, `BinaryRedisPipeline`, and `ClusterPipeline`.

To resolve these issues, we need to identify the new structure or the new names of these interfaces in the updated Jedis version. If these interfaces have been removed or renamed, we need to either remove the extension from the `RedisGraphPipeline` interface or replace them with the new equivalent interfaces.

For the sake of this example, let's assume that the interfaces have been removed or are no longer part of the Jedis package. We will remove the extension of these interfaces from the `RedisGraphPipeline` interface.

```

In this solution, I have removed the extension of the interfaces that are causing the compilation errors, as they are no longer available in the updated Jedis dependency. The `RedisGraphPipeline` interface now only extends `RedisPipeline` and `Closeable`. This should resolve the compilation errors related to missing symbols.
