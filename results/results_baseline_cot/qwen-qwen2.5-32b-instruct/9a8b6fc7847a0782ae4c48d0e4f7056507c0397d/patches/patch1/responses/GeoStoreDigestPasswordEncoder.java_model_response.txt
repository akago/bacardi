1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist, and there are issues with the `PasswordEncoder` class, which suggests that the `PasswordEncoder` class or the package it belongs to has been removed or renamed in the updated dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the import statement `import org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder;` and the usage of `PasswordEncoder` in the `createStringEncoder` method.
   - The `PasswordEncoder` class is used to create an instance and set a password encryptor, but since the package does not exist, the code fails to compile.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `PasswordEncoder` class from `org.jasypt.spring.security` seems to have been removed or moved. We need to find an alternative or update the import to the correct package if it has been renamed.
   - If the `PasswordEncoder` class is no longer available, we need to replace its functionality with an alternative approach.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Remove the import statement for `PasswordEncoder` from `org.jasypt.spring.security`.
   - Replace the `PasswordEncoder` usage with a direct usage of `StrongPasswordEncryptor` since it seems to be the actual class performing the encryption.
   - Ensure the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` is correctly imported.

	/**

    public GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder() {
        setReversible(false);
    }

    @Override
    protected Object createStringEncoder() {
        // Removed PasswordEncoder usage as it's no longer available
        // Instead, directly use StrongPasswordEncryptor for password encryption
        return new StrongPasswordEncryptor();
    }

    @Override

        return new CharArrayPasswordEncoder() {
            StandardByteDigester digester = new StandardByteDigester();
            {
                digester.setAlgorithm("SHA-256");
                digester.setIterations(100000);
                digester.setSaltSizeBytes(16);
                digester.initialize();
            }
            
            @Override
            public String encodePassword(char[] rawPass, Object salt) {
                return new String(Base64.encodeBase64(digester.digest(toBytes(rawPass))));
            }
            @Override
            public boolean isPasswordValid(String encPass, char[] rawPass, Object salt) {
                return digester.matches(toBytes(rawPass), Base64.decodeBase64(encPass.getBytes())); 
            }
        };
    }

    @Override
    public PasswordEncodingType getEncodingType() {
        return PasswordEncodingType.DIGEST;
    }

}
```

In this fix, the `PasswordEncoder` class is removed, and the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` is directly used for password encryption. The `createStringEncoder` method now returns an instance of `StrongPasswordEncryptor` directly, as it seems to be the actual class performing the encryption. The rest of the class remains unchanged to ensure that the functionality is preserved.
