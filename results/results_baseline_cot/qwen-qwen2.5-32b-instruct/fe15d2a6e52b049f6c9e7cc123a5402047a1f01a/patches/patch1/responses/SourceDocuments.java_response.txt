The error messages indicate that the `getInstance()` method cannot be found in the `JAXBToStringStrategy` class. This suggests that the `JAXBToStringStrategy` class in the newer version of the dependency no longer has the `getInstance()` method. This could be due to a change in the API where the `getInstance()` method was removed or renamed.

The `toString()` and `appendFields` method calls in the `SourceDocuments` class and its inner class instances are trying to call `JAXBToStringStrategy.getInstance()`, which is causing the compilation errors. 

To fix this, we need to replace the `getInstance()` method call with an alternative way to get an instance of `ToStringStrategy2`. If the `JAXBToStringStrategy` class no longer provides a static `getInstance()` method, we might need to instantiate `JAXBToStringStrategy` directly or use a different strategy instance.
