1. The errors indicate that the `SelectChannelConnector` class and its methods are no longer available in the newer version of Jetty.
2. In the newer version of Jetty, `SelectChannelConnector` has been replaced by `ServerConnector`.
3. The `setPort` method and `getLocalPort` method need to be updated to use the new `ServerConnector` class.
4. The `Server` class in the newer version of Jetty does not have `setSendServerVersion` and `setSendDateHeader` methods, so these lines need to be removed or replaced with equivalent functionality if available.
5. The minimal changes needed are to replace `SelectChannelConnector` with `ServerConnector` and adjust the method calls accordingly.
6. The changes should not affect the overall functionality of the class.
7. Ensure that the class compiles and adheres to the constraints.
8. The `org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector` import is needed.
