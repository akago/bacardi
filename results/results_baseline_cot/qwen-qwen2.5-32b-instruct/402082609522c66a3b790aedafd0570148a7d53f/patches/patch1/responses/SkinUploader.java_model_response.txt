1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `CommandSource` cannot be found. This suggests that the `CommandSource` class has been removed or moved in the newer version of the Sponge dependency.
   - The errors occur at lines 15, 9, and 17, all related to the `CommandSource` class.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `CommandSource` class is used as a type for the `invoker` field and as a parameter in the constructor.
   - The `CommandSource` class is also imported from the `org.spongepowered.api.command` package.

3. Consider potential fixes that adhere to the following constraints:
   - Since the `CommandSource` class is no longer available, we need to find an alternative or update the import to the correct package if it has been moved.
   - If the `CommandSource` class has been replaced by another class, we need to update the code to use the new class.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Check the Sponge API documentation or changelog for the new version to find the replacement for `CommandSource`.
   - If the class has been moved, update the import statement.
   - If the class has been replaced, update the code to use the new class and ensure that the methods used in the original code are available in the new class.

Based on the analysis, let's assume that the `CommandSource` class has been replaced by `org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource` in the newer version of the Sponge API. Here is the proposed fix:

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.model.auth.Account;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedUploader;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource; // Updated import
import org.spongepowered.api.scheduler.Task;

public class SkinUploader extends SharedUploader {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandSource invoker;

    public SkinUploader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, Account owner, String url) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), owner, url);

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String key) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, key);
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleChangeTask(String oldSkinUrl) {
        Runnable task = new SkinChanger(plugin, owner, url, oldSkinUrl, invoker);
        Task.builder().delay(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES).execute(task).async().submit(plugin);
    }
}
```

In this fix, the import statement for `CommandSource` has been updated to reflect the new location of the class in the newer version of the Sponge API. This should resolve the compilation errors related to the missing `CommandSource` class.
