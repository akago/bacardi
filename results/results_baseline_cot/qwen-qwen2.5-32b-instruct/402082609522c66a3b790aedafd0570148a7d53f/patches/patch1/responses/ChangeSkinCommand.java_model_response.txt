```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    CommandSpec buildSpec();
}
```

The provided code does not require changes to the method signature or the interface itself. The error message suggests that the issue is related to the package or class `CommandSpec` not being found, which is likely due to a change in the external dependency (Sponge API). To fix the compilation error, ensure that the correct version of the Sponge API is included in the project's dependencies. The code itself is correct and adheres to the constraints provided.
