The error messages indicate that the class `CommandSource` cannot be found, which suggests that the `CommandSource` class has been moved or removed in the newer version of the Sponge dependency. The error messages point to the `NameResolver` class where `CommandSource` is used as a type for the `invoker` field and in the constructor. The issue likely stems from a change in the Sponge API, where `CommandSource` might have been moved to a different package or replaced with a different class.

To resolve this issue, we need to identify the correct class or package that `CommandSource` has been moved to in the newer version of the Sponge API. For the purpose of this example, let's assume that `CommandSource` has been moved to `org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource`. We will update the import statement to reflect this change.

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedNameResolver;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.UUID;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource; // Updated import statement
import org.spongepowered.api.entity.living.player.Player;

public class NameResolver extends SharedNameResolver {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandSource invoker;
    private final Player receiver;
    private final boolean keepSkin;

    public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, String targetName, Player receiver
            , boolean keepSkin) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), targetName, keepSkin);

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.receiver = receiver;
        this.keepSkin = keepSkin;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String id) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean hasSkinPermission(UUID uuid) {
        //todo check skin permissions
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleDownloader(UUID uuid) {
        //run this is the same thread
        new SkinDownloader(plugin, invoker, receiver, uuid, keepSkin).run();
    }
}
```

In this solution, the import statement for `CommandSource` has been updated to reflect the new location of the class in the updated Sponge API. This should resolve the compilation errors related to the missing `CommandSource` class.
