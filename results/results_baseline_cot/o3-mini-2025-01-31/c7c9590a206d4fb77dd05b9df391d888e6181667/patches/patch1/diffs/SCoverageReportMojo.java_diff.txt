> 1. The error is caused by the removal of the RenderingContext class from the Maven Doxia dependency.
> 2. In the new API, the SiteRendererSink can be constructed directly with the output directory and the output filename.
> 3. Therefore, the fix is to remove the import for RenderingContext and update the execute() method to use the new constructor.
> 4. This minimal change keeps all other code unchanged.
