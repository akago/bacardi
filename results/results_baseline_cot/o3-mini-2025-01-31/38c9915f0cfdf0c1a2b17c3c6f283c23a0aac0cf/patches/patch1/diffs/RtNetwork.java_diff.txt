> 1. The error occurs because the IoCheckedScalar class has been removed from the org.cactoos.scalar package in the updated dependency.
> 2. In the old code, IoCheckedScalar was used to wrap a scalar and convert checked exceptions into IOExceptions.
> 3. To adapt, the IoCheckedScalar is replaced with a try-catch block that calls the scalar's value() method and wraps any Exception into an IOException.
> 4. This change preserves the function signature and intended behavior while complying with the new API.
