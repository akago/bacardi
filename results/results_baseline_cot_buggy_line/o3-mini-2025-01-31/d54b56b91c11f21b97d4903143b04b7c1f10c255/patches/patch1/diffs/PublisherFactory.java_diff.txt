> 1. The external dependency update removed the PublishMetadata class from the package com.google.cloud.pubsublite.
> 2. Analysis shows that in the new API version, PublishMetadata is now located in the package com.google.cloud.pubsublite.proto.
> 3. To fix the issue, update the import for PublishMetadata to reflect the new package location.
> 4. This minimal change preserves the function signature and allows the code to compile with the updated dependency.
