1. The error messages indicate that the package `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.ng.filter` does not exist, which suggests that the class `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` has been moved or renamed in the newer version of the Struts2 library.
2. To resolve this, we need to find the new location of `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` or an equivalent class in the updated Struts2 library.
3. We will update the import statement and any references to `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` to reflect the new location or equivalent class.
4. We will ensure that the updated code remains functional and adheres to the new API.
5. We will add the necessary import statement for the new location of `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter`.
6. We will replace `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` with the new class name if it has been renamed.
7. We will ensure that the class remains compilable and functional.
