1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.scalar`.
   - This suggests that the class `IoCheckedScalar` has been removed or renamed in the updated version of the `cactoos` dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic import statement is `import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;`.
   - The class `IoCheckedScalar` is used in the `pull` method to handle an `IOException` that might be thrown during the execution of the `Reduced` operation.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The class `IoCheckedScalar` might have been replaced by another class in the updated version of the `cactoos` library.
   - We need to find the equivalent class or method in the updated version of the library that can handle the `IOException` similarly.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the `IoCheckedScalar` with the appropriate class or method from the updated `cactoos` library.
   - Ensure that the replacement class or method can handle the `IOException` in a similar manner.

In the provided solution, `IoCheckedScalar` has been replaced with `OnException` from the `cactoos` library, which is used to handle exceptions. The `OnException` constructor takes a fallback function and a scalar, and it returns the value of the scalar unless an exception is thrown, in which case it returns the fallback value. In this case, `Wallet::zero` is used as the fallback value, assuming `Wallet.zero()` is a method that returns a default `Wallet` instance. Adjust the fallback value according to the actual implementation in your project.
