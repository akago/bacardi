1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the method `getWildcard()` cannot be found in the class `TestListResolver`.
   - This suggests that the method `getWildcard()` has been removed or renamed in the newer version of the `maven-surefire-api` dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is where `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` is called.
   - The `DirectoryScanner` constructor expects a wildcard pattern, which is no longer provided by `TestListResolver`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since the method `getWildcard()` is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to provide the wildcard pattern.
   - The wildcard pattern is typically used to match files in a directory, so we can use a common pattern like `**/*.java` as a replacement.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the call to `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` with a hardcoded wildcard pattern.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain functionality.

```java
package fr.spoonlabs.flacoco.core.test.strategies.classloader.finder.classes.impl;

import fr.spoonlabs.flacoco.core.test.strategies.classloader.finder.classes.ClassFinder;
import org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.List;

public class SourceFolderFinder implements ClassFinder {

    private String srcFolder;

    public SourceFolderFinder(String srcFolder) {
        this.srcFolder = srcFolder;
    }

    @Override
    public String[] getClasses() {
        return getClassesLoc(new File(srcFolder)).toArray(new String[0]);
    }

    static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        // Replace TestListResolver.getWildcard() with a hardcoded wildcard pattern
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, "**/*.java");
        return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
    }
}
```

This fix replaces the call to the removed method with a hardcoded wildcard pattern that should match the same files as the original method intended to match.
