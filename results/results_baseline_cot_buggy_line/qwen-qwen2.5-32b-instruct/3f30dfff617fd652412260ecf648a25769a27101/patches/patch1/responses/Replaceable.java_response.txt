1. The error indicates that the `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` annotation cannot be found, likely due to a change or removal in the newer version of the dependency.
2. The `javax.interceptor` package is part of the Java EE specification, and it seems that the newer version of the dependency might have removed or deprecated this package.
3. To fix the issue, we need to replace the `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` with an alternative that is available in the newer version of the dependency.
4. We will use `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` as it is the Jakarta EE equivalent of `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`.
5. Update the import statement to reflect the change in the package name.
6. Ensure that the rest of the class remains unchanged to maintain its original functionality.
7. The class should now compile without errors.
