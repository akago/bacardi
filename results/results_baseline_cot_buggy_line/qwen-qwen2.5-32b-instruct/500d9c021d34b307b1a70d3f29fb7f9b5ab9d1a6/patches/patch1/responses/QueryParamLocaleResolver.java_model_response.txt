The error messages indicate that the `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` classes cannot be found. This suggests that the dependency related to the `javax.mvc` package has been updated, possibly to a version where these classes have been moved or removed. The `javax.mvc` package is part of the JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) specifications, and it seems that the package has been updated to `jakarta.mvc` as part of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

The solution involves updating the imports to reflect the new package structure and ensuring that the class and method signatures are compatible with the new version of the dependency.

    Logger log;
    
    @Override
    public Locale resolveLocale(final LocaleResolverContext context) {
        final String queryLang = context.getUriInfo()
                .getQueryParameters()
                .getFirst("lang");
        log.log(Level.INFO, "QueryParamLocaleResolver::resolveLocale:lang:{0}", queryLang);
        return queryLang != null ? Locale.forLanguageTag(queryLang) : null;
    }
}
```

In this fix, the `javax.mvc` imports have been replaced with `jakarta.mvc` to reflect the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE. This should resolve the compilation errors related to the missing symbols and non-existent packages.
