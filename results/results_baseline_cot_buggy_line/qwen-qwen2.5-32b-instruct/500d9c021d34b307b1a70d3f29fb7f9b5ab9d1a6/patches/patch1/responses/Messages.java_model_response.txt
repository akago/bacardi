1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the `MvcContext` class cannot be found, which suggests that the class has been removed or moved in the updated dependency.
   - The error occurs at line 23, where `MvcContext` is declared as a private field.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `MvcContext` class is used to get the locale of the current request.
   - The `MvcContext` class is referenced in the `get` method to retrieve the locale for the `ResourceBundle`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `MvcContext` class is likely part of a specific version of a dependency that has been updated.
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been replaced by another class or method in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been moved to a different package or namespace.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Identify the replacement for `MvcContext` in the newer dependency version.
   - Replace the `MvcContext` class with the new class or method that provides the same functionality.
   - Ensure that the new class or method is correctly imported.

Based on the analysis, the `MvcContext` class is likely no longer available in the updated dependency. Assuming the new dependency provides a similar class or method to get the locale, the following fix is proposed:

```java
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;
import jakarta.mvc.MvcContext; // Assuming the new package is jakarta.mvc

/**
 * Provides I18n messages for the UI per request. To get the correct locale, the method {@link MvcContext#getLocale()}
 * is used. This method uses the built-in {@link javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver} of the used MVC Implementation.
 *
 * @author Tobias Erdle
 * @see MvcContext#getLocale()
 * @see javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver
 */
@RequestScoped
@Named("msg")
public class Messages {

    private static final String BASE_NAME = "messages";

    @Inject
    private jakarta.mvc.MvcContext mvcContext; // Update the import and usage of MvcContext

    /**
     * Get the assigned message to some key based on the {@link java.util.Locale} of the current request.
     *
     * @param key the message key to use
     * @return the correct translation assigned to the key for the request locale, a fallback translation or a
     * placeholder for unknown keys.
     */
    public final String get(final String key) {
        final Locale locale = mvcContext.getLocale(); // Ensure the method signature is correct
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, locale);

        return bundle.containsKey(key) ? bundle.getString(key) : formatUnknownKey(key);
    }

    private static String formatUnknownKey(final String key) {
        return String.format("???%s???", key);
    }
}
```

In this fix, the `MvcContext` class is assumed to have been moved to the `jakarta.mvc` package. The import statement and the usage of `MvcContext` have been updated accordingly. If the actual package or method signature differs, those changes should be applied instead.
