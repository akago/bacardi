1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that the `Controller` annotation and `MvcContext` and `Models` classes cannot be found.
   - The package `javax.mvc` does not exist, which suggests that the dependency related to MVC in Java EE has been updated or removed.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `@Controller` annotation and `MvcContext` and `Models` classes are part of the MVC framework that is no longer available in the newer dependency version.
   - The `javax.mvc` package is no longer present, which means the classes and annotations within it are not available.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `javax.mvc` package has been replaced by `jakarta.mvc` in the newer Jakarta EE specification.
   - The `@Controller` annotation, `MvcContext`, and `Models` classes need to be updated to their Jakarta EE equivalents.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace `javax.mvc` with `jakarta.mvc`.
   - Replace `@Controller` with `@jakarta.mvc.Controller`.
   - Replace `MvcContext` and `Models` with their Jakarta EE equivalents.

```java
package com.example.web;

import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.mvc.Controller;
import jakarta.mvc.Models;
import jakarta.mvc.MvcContext;

/**

@Path("locale")
@Controller
@RequestScoped
public class LocaleController {

    @Inject
    MvcContext mvc;

    @Inject
    Models models;

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @GET
    public String get() {
        Locale locale = mvc.getLocale();
        models.put("locale", locale);
        return "locale.xhtml";
    }

}
```

This fix updates the imports and annotations to use the Jakarta EE equivalents, which should resolve the compilation errors caused by the dependency update.
