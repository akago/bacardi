> 1. The error messages indicate that the classes `MvcContext`, `Models`, and `Controller` are not found, which suggests that the javax.mvc package is no longer available or has been renamed in the newer version of the dependency.
> 2. The `javax.mvc` package has been replaced by `jakarta.mvc` in the newer Jakarta EE version.
> 3. The client code needs to be updated to use the new package names.
> 4. The minimal set of changes needed is to update the import statements and class references to use the new package names.
> 5. No side effects are expected from this change as it only involves renaming the package.
> 6. The class will remain fully compilable after the changes.
