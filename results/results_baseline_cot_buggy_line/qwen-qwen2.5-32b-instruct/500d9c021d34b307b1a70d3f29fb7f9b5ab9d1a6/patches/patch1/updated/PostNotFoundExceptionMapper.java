1. The error indicates that the class `Models` cannot be found, which suggests that the import for `Models` is either missing or incorrect.
2. The `Models` class is part of the Jakarta MVC framework, and the import statement should be `import jakarta.mvc.Models;`.
3. The client code needs to update the import statement for `Models` to ensure it is correctly referencing the class from the updated dependency.
4. No other changes are necessary as the rest of the code does not seem to be affected by the dependency update.
5. The fix will only involve updating the import statement for `Models`.
6. There should be no side effects from this change as it only corrects the import statement.
7. The class will be fully compilable after the import statement is corrected.
8. The correct import statement for `Models` is `import jakarta.mvc.Models;`.
