> 1. The error indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found, which suggests that the class or its package has been renamed or removed in the new version of the dependency.
> 2. The import statement for `PublishMetadata` is incorrect or the class no longer exists in the specified package.
> 3. The client code needs to be updated to use the correct class or package name for `PublishMetadata`.
> 4. The fix should not change the function signature of `newPublisher`.
> 5. The minimal change would be to update the import statement to the correct package or class name.
> 6. The change should not affect other parts of the code.
> 7. The class should be compilable after the fix.
> 8. The correct import statement needs to be identified.
