1. The error indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found, which suggests that the class or its package has been removed or renamed in the new version of the dependency.
2. After comparing the old and new API versions, it is found that `PublishMetadata` has been removed and replaced with a new class or structure.
3. The client code needs to be updated to use the new class or structure that replaces `PublishMetadata`.
4. The fix should not change the function signatures and should only update the necessary parts of the code to accommodate the new API.
5. The minimal set of changes needed includes updating the type of the `publisher` variable and any related method calls or imports.
6. The changes should not affect other parts of the code, as the issue is isolated to the dependency update.
7. The class should remain fully compilable after the changes.
8. Additional imports may be needed if the new class or structure is located in a different package.
