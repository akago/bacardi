1. The error indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found, which suggests that the class or its package has been renamed or removed in the new version of the dependency.
2. The import statement for `PublishMetadata` is incorrect or the class no longer exists in the specified package.
3. The client code needs to be updated to use the correct class or package name for `PublishMetadata`.
4. The fix should not change the function signature of `newPublisher`.
5. The minimal change would be to update the import statement to the correct package or class name.
6. The change should not affect other parts of the code.
7. The class should be compilable after the fix.
8. The correct import statement needs to be identified.

interface PublisherFactory {
