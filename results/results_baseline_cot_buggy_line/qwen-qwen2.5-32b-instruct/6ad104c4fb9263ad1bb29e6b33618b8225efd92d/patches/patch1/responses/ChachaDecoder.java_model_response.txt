1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that the classes `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription` from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package cannot be found. This suggests that the BouncyCastle library version used in the project has been updated, and these classes have either been moved or removed.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the imports and the usage of `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription`.
   - The code uses these classes to handle specific cryptographic errors, particularly related to MAC validation.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since the classes `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription` are not found, it is likely that they have been moved to a different package or removed in the newer version of BouncyCastle.
   - To fix the issue, we need to either find the new location of these classes or replace their usage with an alternative approach that does not rely on these specific classes.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Remove the imports for `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription`.
   - Replace the usage of `TlsFatalAlert` with a custom exception or a standard Java exception.
   - If `AlertDescription` is only used to provide a specific error code, we can replace it with a string or a custom enum that represents the error.

package io.github.hapjava.server.impl.crypto;

  public ChachaDecoder(byte[] key, byte[] nonce) throws IOException {

    this.decryptCipher = new ChaChaEngine(20);

    this.decryptCipher.init(false, new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(key), nonce));
  }

  public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] additionalData, byte[] ciphertext)
      throws IOException {

    KeyParameter macKey = initRecordMAC(decryptCipher);

    byte[] calculatedMAC = PolyKeyCreator.create(macKey, additionalData, ciphertext);

    if (!Arrays.constantTimeAreEqual(calculatedMAC, receivedMAC)) {
      throw new IOException("Bad record MAC");
    }

    byte[] output = new byte[ciphertext.length];
    decryptCipher.processBytes(ciphertext, 0, ciphertext.length, output, 0);

    return output;
  }

  public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] ciphertext) throws IOException {
    return decodeCiphertext(receivedMAC, null, ciphertext);
  }

  private KeyParameter initRecordMAC(ChaChaEngine cipher) {
    byte[] firstBlock = new byte[64];
    cipher.processBytes(firstBlock, 0, firstBlock.length, firstBlock, 0);

    // NOTE: The BC implementation puts 'r' after 'k'
    System.arraycopy(firstBlock, 0, firstBlock, 32, 16);
    KeyParameter macKey = new KeyParameter(firstBlock, 16, 32);
    Poly1305KeyGenerator.clamp(macKey.getKey());
    return macKey;
  }
}
```

In this fix, the `TlsFatalAlert` and `AlertDescription` classes have been removed, and the error handling has been simplified by throwing a standard `IOException` with a descriptive message. This approach ensures that the code remains functional and adheres to the constraints provided.
