1. The error messages indicate that the package `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.ng.filter` does not exist, which suggests that the class `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` has been moved or renamed in the newer version of the Struts2 library.
2. To resolve this, we need to find the new location of `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` or an equivalent class in the updated Struts2 library.
3. The fix will involve updating the import statement and any references to `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` to use the new class name or package.
4. We will assume that the new class name is `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter` but it has been moved to a different package, for example, `org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.filter`.
5. We will update the import statement and references accordingly.
6. No other changes are necessary as the rest of the code does not depend on the specific implementation of `StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter`.
7. The updated import statement and references will ensure that the class compiles and adheres to the new API.
