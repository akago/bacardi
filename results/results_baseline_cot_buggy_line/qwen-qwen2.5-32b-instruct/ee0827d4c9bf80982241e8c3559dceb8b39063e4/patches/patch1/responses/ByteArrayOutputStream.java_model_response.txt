1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `ClosedInputStream` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs in the `ByteArrayOutputStream` class at lines 401 and 29.
   - The issue is likely due to a change in the `org.apache.commons.io.input` package, where `ClosedInputStream` is no longer available or has been moved.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the `toInputStream()` method where `ClosedInputStream` is used.
   - The import statement for `ClosedInputStream` is also causing an error.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `ClosedInputStream` is not available, we need to replace it with an alternative that provides a similar functionality.
   - We can use `java.io.InputStream` and create a custom implementation that behaves like `ClosedInputStream`.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the `ClosedInputStream` usage with a custom implementation.
   - Remove the import statement for `ClosedInputStream`.
   - Ensure the custom implementation mimics the behavior of `ClosedInputStream`.

}
```

In this solution, the `ClosedInputStream` is replaced with an anonymous inner class that implements `InputStream` and always returns `-1` when `read()` is called, mimicking the behavior of a closed stream. This ensures that the code remains functional without relying on the `ClosedInputStream` class.
