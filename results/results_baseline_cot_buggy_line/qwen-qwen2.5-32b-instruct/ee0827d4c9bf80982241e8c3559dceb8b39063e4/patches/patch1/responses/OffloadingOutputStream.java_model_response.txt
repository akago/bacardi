1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that the class `ThresholdingOutputStream` cannot be found, which suggests that the dependency `org.apache.commons.io.output.ThresholdingOutputStream` has been removed or renamed in the updated dependency version.
   - The `@Override` annotations are causing errors because the methods they are supposed to override are no longer present in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The class `OffloadingOutputStream` extends `ThresholdingOutputStream`, which is causing the "cannot find symbol" error.
   - The `@Override` annotations on methods like `getStream`, `thresholdReached`, and `close` are causing errors because these methods no longer override methods from a supertype.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `ThresholdingOutputStream` is not found, we need to either find a replacement class or refactor the code to not depend on it.
   - Remove the `@Override` annotations from methods that no longer override methods from a supertype.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace `ThresholdingOutputStream` with a similar class or refactor the code to not extend any class.
   - Remove the `@Override` annotations from methods that no longer override methods from a supertype.

In this solution, I have removed the `extends ThresholdingOutputStream` and the `@Override` annotations for methods that no longer override methods from a supertype. This is based on the assumption that `ThresholdingOutputStream` is no longer available or has been refactored in the new dependency version. The class now stands alone without extending `ThresholdingOutputStream`, and the methods are no longer marked as overrides.
