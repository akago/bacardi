1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `Matchers` cannot be found in the package `org.hamcrest`.
   - This suggests that the `Matchers` class has been moved or removed in the updated version of the `hamcrest` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Matchers` class is used in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods to create matchers for the URI properties.
   - The `Matchers` class is imported at the top of the file, but it seems that the import is no longer valid due to the dependency update.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Matchers` class is part of the `hamcrest` library, and it seems that the class has been moved or renamed in the newer version.
   - The `Matchers` class is often used to create matchers for various types, and it's possible that the functionality has been moved to a different class or package in the newer version.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the import statement for `Matchers` with the correct import from the updated `hamcrest` library.
   - If the `Matchers` class has been moved to a different package, update the import statement accordingly.
   - If the `Matchers` class has been renamed, update the import and usage in the code.

Based on the analysis, the `Matchers` class might have been moved to a different package or renamed in the updated `hamcrest` library. Assuming the `Matchers` class has been moved to `org.hamcrest.core`, the following patch can be applied:

```java
package com.jcabi.http.mock;

import java.net.URI;
import org.hamcrest.Matcher;
import org.hamcrest.core.StringContains;

/**
 * Convenient set of matchers for {@link MkQuery}.

 * @since 1.5
 */
@SuppressWarnings("PMD.ProhibitPublicStaticMethods")
public final class MkQueryMatchers {

    /**

     */
    private MkQueryMatchers() {
        // Utility class - cannot instantiate
    }

    /**

     */
    public static Matcher<MkQuery> hasBody(final Matcher<String> matcher) {
        return new MkQueryBodyMatcher(matcher);
    }

    /**

     * Note that for a valid match to occur, the header entry must exist
     * <i>and</i> its value(s) must match the given matcher.
     *
     * @param header The header to check.

     */
    public static Matcher<MkQuery> hasHeader(
        final String header,
        final Matcher<Iterable<? extends String>> matcher
    ) {
        return new MkQueryHeaderMatcher(header, matcher);
    }

    /**
     * Matches the path of the MkQuery.
     *

     * @return Matcher for checking the path of MkQuery
     */
    public static Matcher<MkQuery> hasPath(final Matcher<String> path) {
        return new MkQueryUriMatcher(
            new Matcher<URI>() {
                @Override
                public boolean matchesSafely(URI item) {
                    return path.matches(item.getRawPath());
                }

                @Override
                public void describeTo(org.hamcrest.Description description) {
                    description.appendText("URI with path ");
                    path.describeTo(description);
                }
            }
        );
    }

    /**
     * Matches the query of the MkQuery.
     *
     * @param query The query to check.
     * @return Matcher for checking the query of MkQuery
     */
    public static Matcher<MkQuery> hasQuery(final Matcher<String> query) {
        return new MkQueryUriMatcher(
            new Matcher<URI>() {
                @Override
                public boolean matchesSafely(URI item) {
                    return query.matches(item.getRawQuery());
                }

                @Override
                public void describeTo(org.hamcrest.Description description) {
                    description.appendText("URI with query ");
                    query.describeTo(description);
                }
            }
        );
    }
}
```

In this patch, the `Matchers` import is removed and replaced with custom matchers for `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods to ensure the code compiles and functions correctly with the updated dependency. If the `Matchers` class is still available in a different package, the import should be updated to reflect the new location.
