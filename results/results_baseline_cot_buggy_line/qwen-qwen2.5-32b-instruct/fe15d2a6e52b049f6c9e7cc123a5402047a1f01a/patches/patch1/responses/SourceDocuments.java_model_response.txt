The error message indicates that the method `getInstance()` is not found in the class `org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons.lang.JAXBToStringStrategy`. This suggests that the dependency update has removed or changed the `getInstance()` method. The error occurs in multiple places where the `toString()` method is overridden to generate a string representation of the object using the `JAXBToStringStrategy`.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the calls to `getInstance()` and replace it with a new instance of `JAXBToStringStrategy`. if the method no longer exists in the updated dependency. This will ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly with the new dependency version.
