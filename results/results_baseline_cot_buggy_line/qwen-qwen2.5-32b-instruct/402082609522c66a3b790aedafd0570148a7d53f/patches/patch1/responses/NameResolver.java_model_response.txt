1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `CommandSource` cannot be found, which suggests that the `CommandSource` class has been removed or moved in the updated version of the Sponge API dependency.
   - The error occurs in the `NameResolver` class, specifically in the constructor and the import statement.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `CommandSource` class is used in the constructor of `NameResolver` and is declared as a field.
   - The import statement for `CommandSource` is also present in the code.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since the `CommandSource` class is no longer available, we need to find an alternative or remove the dependency on `CommandSource`.
   - If the `CommandSource` class has been replaced by another class in the new version of the Sponge API, we should import and use that class instead.
   - If the `CommandSource` class is no longer needed, we can remove the field and the constructor parameter.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Check the Sponge API documentation or changelog for the updated version to find the replacement for `CommandSource`.
   - If a replacement is found, update the import and use the new class.
   - If no replacement is found and the `CommandSource` is not critical, remove the field and the constructor parameter.

Based on the analysis, let's assume that the `CommandSource` class has been replaced by `org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource` in the new version of the Sponge API. Here is the proposed fix:

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedNameResolver;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.UUID;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource; // Updated import statement
import org.spongepowered.api.entity.living.player.Player;

public class NameResolver extends SharedNameResolver {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandSource invoker;
    private final Player receiver;
    private final boolean keepSkin;

    public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, String targetName, Player receiver
            , boolean keepSkin) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), targetName, keepSkin);

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.receiver = receiver;
        this.keepSkin = keepSkin;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String id) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean hasSkinPermission(UUID uuid) {
        //todo check skin permissions
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleDownloader(UUID uuid) {
        //run this is the same thread
        new SkinDownloader(plugin, invoker, receiver, uuid, keepSkin).run();
    }
}
```

In this fix, the import statement for `CommandSource` has been updated to reflect the new package structure in the updated Sponge API. If the `CommandSource` class has been removed and there is no replacement, the field and constructor parameter would need to be removed, and any references to `invoker` would need to be handled appropriately. However, without more context on the Sponge API changes, this is the most conservative approach to address the compilation error.
