1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `CommandSpec` cannot be found, and the package `org.spongepowered.api.command.spec` does not exist.
   - This suggests that the `CommandSpec` class has been removed or moved in the updated version of the Sponge API dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The client code imports `org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec` and uses it in the `ChangeSkinCommand` interface.
   - The method `CommandSpec buildSpec()` is defined in the interface, which is now causing a compilation error due to the missing `CommandSpec` class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since the `CommandSpec` class is no longer available, we need to find an alternative or update the import to match the new structure of the Sponge API.
   - If the `CommandSpec` class has been replaced by another class or moved to a different package, we need to update the import statement accordingly.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - If the `CommandSpec` class has been replaced by another class, we need to update the return type of the `buildSpec` method and the import statement.
   - If the `CommandSpec` class has been moved to a different package, we need to update the import statement to the new package.
   - If the `CommandSpec` class has been removed and there is no direct replacement, we need to refactor the code to use the new API structure.

Since the exact replacement or new structure of the Sponge API is not provided, I will assume that the `CommandSpec` class has been moved to a different package. If the new package is `org.spongepowered.api.command.args`, the following fix can be applied:

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.args.CommandElement;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    CommandElement buildSpec();
}
```

If the `CommandSpec` class has been replaced by another class, the import and return type of the `buildSpec` method should be updated to reflect the new class. If the exact replacement is known, please provide the new class name for a more accurate fix.
