The error messages indicate that several classes and interfaces from the `redis.clients.jedis.commands` package are not found. This suggests that the Jedis library version used in the project has been updated, and these classes/interfaces have been removed or renamed. The solution involves removing the references to these missing classes and interfaces, as well as adjusting the imports to reflect the current state of the Jedis library.

Given the constraints, the fix will involve:
- Removing the import statements for the missing classes.
- Removing the implementation of the missing interfaces from the `RedisGraphTransaction` interface.
- Ensuring that the remaining code is still valid and compilable.

    List<Response<?>> execGetResponse();

    /**

    String discard();
}
```

In this solution, I have removed the imports and interface implementations that are causing the compilation errors. The remaining code is kept as is, ensuring that the interface still provides the necessary methods for interacting with RedisGraph, but without the dependencies on the removed Jedis interfaces.
