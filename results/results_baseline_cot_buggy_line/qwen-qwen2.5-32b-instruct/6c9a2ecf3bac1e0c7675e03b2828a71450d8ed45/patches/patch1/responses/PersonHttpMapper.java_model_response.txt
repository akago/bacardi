1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `@Mapper` annotation could not be retrieved. This suggests that the MapStruct library, which provides the `@Mapper` annotation, might have undergone changes in its latest version that affect how the annotation is processed or used.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `@Mapper` annotation is used on the `PersonHttpMapper` interface. This annotation is used by MapStruct to generate the implementation of the interface at compile time.
   - The error occurs at line 11, which is where the `@Mapper` annotation is applied.

3. Consider potential fixes that adhere to the following constraints:
   - The issue might be due to a change in the MapStruct library that requires additional configuration or annotations to be used with `@Mapper`.
   - The `@Mapper` annotation might need to be accompanied by additional configuration to work with the updated MapStruct version.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Add the `@Mapper` annotation with the `componentModel` attribute set to "spring" to ensure that the mapper is correctly configured with the updated MapStruct version.
   - Ensure that the correct imports are used, considering the newer dependency version.

```java
package io.github.wesleyosantos91.api.v1.mapper;

import io.github.wesleyosantos91.api.v1.request.PersonRequest;
import io.github.wesleyosantos91.api.v1.response.PersonResponse;
import io.github.wesleyosantos91.core.domain.PersonDomain;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import org.mapstruct.Mapper;
import org.mapstruct.factory.Mappers;

@Mapper(componentModel = "spring")
public interface PersonHttpMapper {

    PersonHttpMapper INSTANCE = Mappers.getMapper(PersonHttpMapper.class);
    PersonDomain toDomain(PersonRequest request);
    PersonRequest toRequest(PersonDomain domain);

    PersonDomain toDomain(PersonResponse response);
    PersonResponse toResponse(PersonDomain domain);

    default List<PersonResponse> toListResponse(List<PersonDomain> domains){
        List<PersonResponse> list = new ArrayList<>();
        domains.forEach(d-> list.add(toResponse(d)));
        return list;
    }
}
```

In this fix, the `@Mapper` annotation is updated to include the `componentModel` attribute set to "spring". This is a common requirement when using MapStruct with Spring to ensure that the generated mapper is correctly managed by the Spring container. This change should resolve the issue with the `@Mapper` annotation not being retrieved correctly.
