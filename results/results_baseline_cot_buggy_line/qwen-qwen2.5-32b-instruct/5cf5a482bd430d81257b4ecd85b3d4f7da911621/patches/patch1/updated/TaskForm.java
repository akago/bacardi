1. The error indicates that the `MvcBinding` class cannot be found, which suggests that the `javax.mvc.binding` package is no longer available or has been renamed in the newer version of the dependency.
2. The `MvcBinding` annotation is used twice in the `TaskForm` class, and both instances need to be addressed.
3. Since the `MvcBinding` class is not found, it is likely that the annotation has been removed or replaced in the newer version of the dependency.
4. The fix should remove the `@MvcBinding` annotations and the import statement for `javax.mvc.binding.MvcBinding`.
5. The removal of the `@MvcBinding` annotations should not affect the functionality of the class, as the annotations are not required for the class to compile and function.
6. No additional imports are needed for this fix.
7. The class should compile without errors after the removal of the `@MvcBinding` annotations and the import statement.
