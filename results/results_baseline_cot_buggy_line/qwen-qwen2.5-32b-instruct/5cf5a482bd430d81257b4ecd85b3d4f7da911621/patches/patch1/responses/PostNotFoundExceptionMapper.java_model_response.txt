1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `Models` class cannot be found, which suggests that the class `Models` is no longer available in the current dependency version.
   - The error occurs at line 29, where the `Models` class is referenced.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the declaration and usage of the `Models` class.
   - The `Models` class is used to put an error message into the model, which is then presumably used in a view.

3. Consider potential fixes that adhere to the following constraints:
   - Since the `Models` class is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to handle the model in the context of the updated dependency.
   - The `javax.mvc` package, which contains the `Models` class, is not part of the standard Java EE or Jakarta EE packages. It seems the dependency related to this package has been updated or removed.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Remove the `Models` class declaration and its usage.
   - Since the `Models` class is used to put an error message into the model, we need to find an alternative way to handle this. If the `Models` class was used to pass data to a view, we might need to use a different approach, such as using a request attribute or a session attribute, depending on the context.
   - Ensure that the `javax.mvc` import is removed as well.

```java
package com.example.config;

import com.example.domain.TaskNotFoundException;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

/**

@Provider
public class PostNotFoundExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<TaskNotFoundException> {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(TaskNotFoundException exception) {
        log.log(Level.INFO, "handling exception : PostNotFoundException");
        // Removed models.put("error", exception.getMessage());
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).entity("error.xhtml").build();
    }

}
```

In this fix, the `Models` class and its usage have been removed because the class is no longer available in the updated dependency. The error message that was previously added to the model is no longer being set, as there is no direct replacement provided in the context of the error message. If the error message needs to be passed to a view, additional context or a different approach would be required, which is not specified in the provided information.
