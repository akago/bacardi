1. The error messages indicate that the `javax.servlet` package is missing, which is likely due to a change in the dependency or the environment.
2. The `FilterRegistration` and `DispatcherType` classes are part of the `javax.servlet` package, which is not found.
3. The `AbstractConfigFilter` class does not implement `javax.servlet.Filter`, causing a type mismatch.
4. The fix will involve ensuring the correct imports are present and that the `AbstractConfigFilter` is correctly used.
5. The minimal changes will be to add the necessary imports and adjust the `addFilter` method call.
6. The changes should not affect the functionality of the class.
7. The class should compile after the changes.
8. Additional imports from `javax.servlet` are needed.
