1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `Matchers` cannot be found in the package `org.hamcrest`.
   - This suggests that the `Matchers` class has been moved or removed in the updated version of the Hamcrest library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Matchers` class is used in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods to create matchers for the URI properties.
   - The `Matchers` class is imported at the top of the file, but it seems that this import is no longer valid due to the dependency update.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Matchers` class might have been moved to a different package or replaced with a different class in the updated version of the Hamcrest library.
   - The fix should involve updating the import statement to the correct package or class that now provides the required functionality.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statement to the correct package or class that provides the `Matchers` functionality.
   - Ensure that the updated import statement is compatible with the updated dependency version.

In this fix, I have replaced the `Matchers` import with `org.hamcrest.core.IsEqual` as a placeholder. However, the actual fix would depend on the specific changes made in the updated Hamcrest library. If `Matchers` was moved to a different package, the import should be updated accordingly. If `Matchers` was replaced with a different class, the replacement class should be used instead. The provided fix assumes that `IsEqual` can be used as a replacement, but this may need to be adjusted based on the actual changes in the Hamcrest library.
