1. The error indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found in the package `com.google.cloud.pubsublite`.
2. This suggests that the class `PublishMetadata` has been removed or renamed in the newer version of the dependency.
3. To fix the issue, we need to identify the replacement for `PublishMetadata` in the new version of the dependency.
4. We will replace `PublishMetadata` with the new class name or type that is now used in the new version of the dependency.
5. We will also update the import statement to reflect the new class name or type.
6. We will ensure that the replacement class or type is compatible with the rest of the code.
7. We will add the necessary import statement for the new class or type.
