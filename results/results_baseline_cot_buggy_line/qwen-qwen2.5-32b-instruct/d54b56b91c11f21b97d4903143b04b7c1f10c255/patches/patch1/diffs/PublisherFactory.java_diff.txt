> 1. The error indicates that the class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found in the package `com.google.cloud.pubsublite`.
> 2. This suggests that the class `PublishMetadata` has been removed or renamed in the newer version of the dependency.
> 3. To fix the issue, we need to identify the replacement for `PublishMetadata` in the new version of the dependency.
> 4. We will replace `PublishMetadata` with the new class name or type that is now used in the new version of the dependency.
> 5. We will also update the import statement to reflect the new class name or type.
> 6. We will ensure that the replacement class or type is compatible with the rest of the code.
> 7. We will add the necessary import statement for the new class or type.
