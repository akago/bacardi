1. The `PasswordEncoder` class from `org.jasypt.spring.security` is no longer available, leading to compilation errors.
2. The new version of the library might have deprecated or removed the `PasswordEncoder` class.
3. The client code needs to be updated to use the new API or an alternative approach.
4. The fix should not change the function signatures but may require changes to the class structure and imports.
5. The minimal changes needed are to replace the `PasswordEncoder` usage with a compatible alternative or remove the dependency on it.
6. The changes should not introduce new errors or break existing functionality.
