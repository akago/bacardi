1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `query1NN(double[])` method cannot be found on the `KDTree` object.
   - The error occurs in the `prunePointsWithinDistance` method.
   - The issue is likely due to a change in the `KDTree` class from the `org.tinspin.index.kdtree` package, where the method signature or the method itself might have been changed or removed.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `prunePointsWithinDistance` method uses the `query1NN` method to find the nearest neighbor.
   - The `KDTree` class is used to store and query points, and the method `query1NN` is used to find the nearest neighbor to a given point.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `query1NN` method might have been renamed or its signature changed in the updated `KDTree` class.
   - The fix should involve updating the method call to match the new method signature or name in the updated `KDTree` class.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Check the updated `KDTree` documentation to find the correct method to replace `query1NN`.
   - Replace the `query1NN` method call with the correct method call.
   - Ensure that the method call returns a distance that can be compared with `distanceTolerance`.

In the provided fix, the `query1NN` method call has been replaced with `nearestNeighbor`, which is a common method name for finding the nearest neighbor in a KDTree. The `getDistance` method is used to retrieve the distance from the nearest neighbor result. This change assumes that the `KDTree` class in the updated dependency has a `nearestNeighbor` method that returns an object with a `getDistance` method. If the actual method names differ, they should be replaced with the correct ones from the updated dependency documentation.
