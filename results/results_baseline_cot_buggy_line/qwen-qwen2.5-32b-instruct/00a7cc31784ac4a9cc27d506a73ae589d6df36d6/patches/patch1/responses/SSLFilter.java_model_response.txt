1. Examine the error message:
   - The first error indicates that the `PEER_ADDRESS` variable is not found, which suggests that the constant or variable is missing in the current context.
   - The second error indicates that the constructor `SslFilter(SSLContext, boolean)` is not available in the updated version of the `SslFilter` class, implying that the constructor signature has changed.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `PEER_ADDRESS` is used in the `onPreAdd` method to set an attribute on the session, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code.
   - The constructor `SSLFilter(SSLContext, boolean)` is called in the `SSLFilter` class, but the updated version of the `SslFilter` class does not support this constructor.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Define the `PEER_ADDRESS` constant or variable to resolve the first error.
   - Modify the constructor call to match the available constructor in the updated `SslFilter` class.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Add a constant `PEER_ADDRESS` to the `SSLFilter` class.
   - Change the constructor call to use the available constructor in the updated `SslFilter` class.

    }
}
```

In this fix, the `PEER_ADDRESS` constant is defined to resolve the first error. The constructor that includes the `autoStart` parameter is modified to use the available constructor and potentially configure `autoStart` separately if needed. The `@Override` annotation is removed from the `onPreAdd` method as it is no longer overriding a method from the superclass, based on the assumption that the method signature has changed in the updated dependency.
