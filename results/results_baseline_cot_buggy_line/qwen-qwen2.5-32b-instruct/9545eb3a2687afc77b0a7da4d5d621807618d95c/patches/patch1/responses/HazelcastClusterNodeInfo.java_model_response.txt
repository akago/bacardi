1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `Member` class cannot be found in the `com.hazelcast.core` package.
   - This suggests that the `Member` class has been removed or moved in the updated version of the Hazelcast dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `Member` class is used in the constructor of `HazelcastClusterNodeInfo` and is imported from `com.hazelcast.core`.
   - The `Member` class is used to get the hostname and node ID, and to check if the node is a senior member.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Member` class might have been replaced by another class in the newer version of Hazelcast.
   - The `Member` class might have been moved to a different package.
   - The `Member` class might have been renamed.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Identify the new class or method that replaces the `Member` class functionality.
   - Update the import statement to reflect the new location or name of the class.
   - Modify the constructor and method calls to use the new class or method.

To fix the issue, we need to update the code to use the new class or method that replaces the `Member` class. Assuming the `Member` class has been replaced by a new class called `ClusterMember` in the same package, the following patch can be applied:

```java
package org.jivesoftware.openfire.plugin.util.cluster;

import org.jivesoftware.openfire.cluster.ClusterManager;
import org.jivesoftware.openfire.cluster.ClusterNodeInfo;
import org.jivesoftware.openfire.cluster.NodeID;
import org.jivesoftware.openfire.plugin.util.cache.ClusteredCacheFactory;

import com.hazelcast.core.ClusterMember; // Updated import statement

/**
 * Cluster Node information as provided by Hazelcast.
 *
 * @author Tom Evans
 * @author Gaston Dombiak
 */
public class HazelcastClusterNodeInfo implements ClusterNodeInfo {

    public static final String HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE = "hostname";
    public static final String NODE_ID_ATTRIBUTE = "node-id";
    private final String hostname;
    private final NodeID nodeID;
    private final long joinedTime;
    private final boolean seniorMember;

    public HazelcastClusterNodeInfo(final ClusterMember member, final long joinedTime) { // Updated parameter type
        this.hostname = member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) + " (" + member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() + ")";
        this.nodeID = ClusteredCacheFactory.getNodeID(member);
        this.joinedTime = joinedTime;
        this.seniorMember = ClusterManager.getSeniorClusterMember().equals(nodeID);
    }

    public String getHostName() {
        return hostname;
    }

    public NodeID getNodeID() {
        return nodeID;
    }

    public long getJoinedTime() {
        return joinedTime;
    }

    public boolean isSeniorMember() {
        return seniorMember;
    }
}
```

In this patch, the `Member` class has been replaced with `ClusterMember` in the import statement and in the constructor parameter. This assumes that the `ClusterMember` class has the same methods as the `Member` class. If the methods have different names or the class structure has changed, further adjustments would be necessary.
