1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the method `getInstance()` cannot be found in the class `liquibase.executor.ExecutorService`.
   - This suggests that the method `getInstance()` has been removed or renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is where `ExecutorService.getInstance().getExecutor(this).execute(...)` is called.
   - The error occurs because the `getInstance()` method is no longer available in the updated version of the `ExecutorService` class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The fix should involve replacing the call to `getInstance()` with the correct method or approach to obtain an instance of `ExecutorService`.
   - If the method has been replaced with a different static method or constructor, the code should be updated accordingly.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Check the updated documentation or source code of the `ExecutorService` class to find the new method or approach to obtain an instance.
   - Replace the call to `getInstance()` with the new method or approach.

Based on the analysis, the following patch is proposed to fix the issue. Assuming the new method to obtain an instance of `ExecutorService` is `getExecutorServiceInstance()`:

```java
package liquibase.ext.mssql.database;

import liquibase.CatalogAndSchema;
import liquibase.exception.LiquibaseException;
import liquibase.executor.Executor;
import liquibase.executor.ExecutorService;
import liquibase.ext.mssql.statement.DropStoredProcedureStatement;

public class MSSQLDatabase extends liquibase.database.core.MSSQLDatabase {
    
    @Override
    public int getPriority() {
        return PRIORITY_DATABASE;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void dropDatabaseObjects(CatalogAndSchema schemaToDrop) throws LiquibaseException {
        super.dropDatabaseObjects(schemaToDrop);
        Executor executor = ExecutorService.getExecutorServiceInstance().getExecutor(this);
        executor.execute(new DropStoredProcedureStatement(this.getLiquibaseCatalogName(), this.getLiquibaseSchemaName()));
    }
}
```

In this patch, the `ExecutorService.getInstance()` call has been replaced with `ExecutorService.getExecutorServiceInstance()` to reflect the change in the dependency. This is a hypothetical method name, and the actual method name should be replaced with the correct one from the updated dependency documentation.
