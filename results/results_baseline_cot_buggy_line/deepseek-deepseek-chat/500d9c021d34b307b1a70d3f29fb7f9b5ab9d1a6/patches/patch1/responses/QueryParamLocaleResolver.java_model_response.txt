1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the package `javax.mvc.locale` does not exist, which suggests that the package has been moved or renamed in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The errors occur in the imports and class definitions related to `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext`.
   - This issue is likely caused by a breaking change in the Jakarta MVC specification, where the package names have been updated from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*`.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the imports and the class definition that implements `LocaleResolver`.
   - The `resolveLocale` method is also affected because it uses `LocaleResolverContext`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The imports need to be updated to reflect the new package names in the Jakarta MVC specification.
   - The class definition and method implementation should remain unchanged, but the imports should be updated to use the `jakarta.*` namespace.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the imports from `javax.mvc.locale` to `jakarta.mvc.locale`.
   - Ensure that the class and method signatures remain unchanged.
   - Verify that the updated imports resolve the compilation errors.
