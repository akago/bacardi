<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `Models` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 29 in the `PostNotFoundExceptionMapper` class.
   - This suggests that the `Models` class from the `javax.mvc` package is either missing or has been moved/renamed in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is `Models models;`, which is used to inject the `Models` instance.
   - The `Models` class is part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, and it seems that the import statement for `javax.mvc.Models` is incorrect or outdated.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Models` class might have been moved to a different package in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The correct import statement needs to be updated to reflect the new package location of the `Models` class.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement for the `Models` class to the correct package.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain functionality.

Based on the analysis, here is the fixed Java class:

```java
/*

 * To change this template file, choose Tools | Templates

 */
package com.example.config;

import com.example.domain.TaskNotFoundException;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.mvc.Models;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

/**
 *
 * @author hantsy
 */
@Provider
public class PostNotFoundExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<TaskNotFoundException> {

    @Inject Logger log;
    //private static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(PostNotFoundExceptionMapper.class.getName());

    @Inject
    Models models;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(TaskNotFoundException exception) {
        log.log(Level.INFO, "handling exception : PostNotFoundException");
        models.put("error", exception.getMessage());
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).entity("error.xhtml").build();
    }

}
```

In this case, the `Models` class is still part of the `javax.mvc` package, so the import statement remains the same. If the `Models` class had been moved to a different package, the import statement would need to be updated accordingly. For example, if it were moved to `jakarta.mvc`, the import would be:

```java
import jakarta.mvc.Models;
```

However, based on the current analysis, the import statement is correct, and the issue might be related to the dependency not being properly included in the project. Ensure that the `javax.mvc` dependency is correctly added to the project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
