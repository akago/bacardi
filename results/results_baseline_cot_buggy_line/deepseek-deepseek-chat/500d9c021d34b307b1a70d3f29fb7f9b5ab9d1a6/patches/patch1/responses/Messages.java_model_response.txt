1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `MvcContext` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 23 in the `Messages` class where `MvcContext` is declared.
   - This suggests that the `MvcContext` class is either missing or has been moved/renamed in the updated dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the declaration of `private MvcContext mvcContext;`.
   - The import statement `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;` is likely incorrect or outdated.
   - The code is part of a Jakarta MVC application, and the `MvcContext` class might have been relocated or renamed in newer versions.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been moved to a different package in the newer version of the Jakarta MVC specification.
   - The correct import statement needs to be updated to reflect the new package location of `MvcContext`.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package for `MvcContext`.
   - Ensure that the new import statement aligns with the updated dependency version.
   - Verify that the `MvcContext` class is available in the new package and that it provides the necessary functionality.

    public final String get(final String key) {
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, mvcContext.getLocale());

        return bundle.containsKey(key) ? bundle.getString(key) : formatUnknownKey(key);
    }

    private static String formatUnknownKey(final String key) {
        return String.format("???%s???", key);
    }
}
```

The fix involves updating the import statement from `javax.mvc.MvcContext` to `jakarta.mvc.MvcContext` to align with the newer Jakarta MVC specification. This change ensures that the `MvcContext` class is correctly resolved, addressing the compilation error.
