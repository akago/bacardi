<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `CommandSource` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs in lines 14, 18, and 8 of the `NameResolver` class.
   - The issue is related to the import statement `import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;`.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `CommandSource` class is used as a type for the `invoker` field and as a parameter in the constructor.
   - The import statement for `CommandSource` is incorrect or outdated.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `CommandSource` class might have been moved or renamed in the newer version of the Sponge API.
   - Research the correct package or class name for `CommandSource` in the updated dependency version.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct package or class name for `CommandSource`.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain functionality.

Based on the analysis, the issue is likely due to a change in the Sponge API where the `CommandSource` class has been moved or renamed. After researching the Sponge API documentation, it appears that `CommandSource` has been replaced by `CommandCause` in newer versions. Here is the fixed class:

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedNameResolver;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.UUID;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandCause;
import org.spongepowered.api.entity.living.player.Player;

public class NameResolver extends SharedNameResolver {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandCause invoker;
    private final Player receiver;
    private final boolean keepSkin;

    public NameResolver(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandCause invoker, String targetName, Player receiver
            , boolean keepSkin) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), targetName, keepSkin);

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.receiver = receiver;
        this.keepSkin = keepSkin;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String id) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean hasSkinPermission(UUID uuid) {
        //todo check skin permissions
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleDownloader(UUID uuid) {
        //run this is the same thread
        new SkinDownloader(plugin, invoker, receiver, uuid, keepSkin).run();
    }
}
```

In this fix, the `CommandSource` class has been replaced with `CommandCause`, which is the correct class in the updated Sponge API. The import statement has been updated accordingly, and the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain functionality.
