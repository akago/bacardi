1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the constructor `Representer()` is undefined.
   - The error occurs at line 37 in the `YamlModelReader` class.
   - This suggests that the `Representer` class from the `snakeyaml` library has been updated, and the no-argument constructor is no longer available.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic line is `yaml = new Yaml(constructor, new Representer(), new DumperOptions(), new ModelResolver());`.
   - The `Representer` class is being instantiated without any arguments, which is no longer supported in the updated version of `snakeyaml`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Representer` class likely now requires arguments in its constructor.
   - We need to determine the correct way to instantiate `Representer` in the updated version of `snakeyaml`.
   - The fix should involve providing the necessary arguments to the `Representer` constructor.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the instantiation of `Representer` to use the appropriate constructor.
   - Ensure that the `Representer` is configured correctly for the `Yaml` instance.
   - The fix should not affect the overall functionality of the `YamlModelReader` class.

```

In this fix, the `Representer` is instantiated with a `DumperOptions` object, which is a common requirement in newer versions of the `snakeyaml` library. This change ensures that the `YamlModelReader` class compiles correctly and maintains its intended functionality.
