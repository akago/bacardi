1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `LengthOf` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.iterable`.
   - This suggests that the `LengthOf` class has either been moved to a different package or removed in the updated version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `LengthOf` class is used in the `TaxBeneficiaries` constructor to filter nodes based on the length of their score suffixes.
   - The code relies on the `LengthOf` class to determine the length of an iterable.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `LengthOf` class might have been moved to a different package in the newer version of `cactoos`.
   - Alternatively, the functionality of `LengthOf` might be replaced by a different class or method in the updated library.
   - The fix should ensure that the filtering logic remains intact while using the correct class or method from the updated dependency.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Research the new location or replacement for the `LengthOf` class in the updated `cactoos` library.
   - Update the import statement to reflect the correct package or class.
   - Modify the code to use the new class or method if necessary.

Based on the analysis, the `LengthOf` class has been moved to a different package in the newer version of the `cactoos` library. The correct import should be updated to reflect this change. Here is the fixed class:

    /**

    public TaxBeneficiaries(final Iterable<Remote> nodes) {
        super(() -> new Sorted<>(
            Comparator.comparing(Remote::score),
            new Filtered<>(
                // @checkstyle MagicNumberCheck (1 line)
                n -> new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue() >= 16,
                nodes
            )
        ));
    }
}
```

In this fix, the import statement for `LengthOf` has been updated to `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`, which is the correct package in the newer version of the `cactoos` library. The rest of the code remains unchanged, ensuring that the functionality is preserved.
