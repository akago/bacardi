1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `RandomText` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.text`.
   - This suggests that the `RandomText` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the newer version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic import is `import org.cactoos.text.RandomText;`.
   - The `RandomText` class is used in the `Fake` constructor to create a repeated sequence of random text values.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `RandomText` class might have been replaced by another class in the newer version of `cactoos`.
   - A possible replacement could be `org.cactoos.text.TextOf` or `org.cactoos.text.RandomString`.
   - The fix should replace the `RandomText` class with an equivalent class that provides similar functionality.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the import statement with the correct class from the newer version of `cactoos`.
   - Update the code to use the new class in place of `RandomText`.

```

In this fix, the `RandomText` class has been replaced with `RandomString`, which is a more likely candidate for generating random text in the newer versions of the `cactoos` library. This change should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the intended functionality of the code.
