1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.scalar`.
   - This suggests that the `IoCheckedScalar` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the newer version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic import is `import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;`.
   - The `IoCheckedScalar` class is used in the `pull` method to wrap a `Reduced` scalar and handle IO exceptions.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `IoCheckedScalar` class might have been replaced or its functionality might have been moved to another class in the newer version of `cactoos`.
   - We need to find an equivalent class or method in the newer version of `cactoos` that provides similar functionality.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Research the newer version of `cactoos` to find the replacement for `IoCheckedScalar`.
   - Update the import statement and the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` in the `pull` method.
   - Ensure that the new class or method provides the same functionality of wrapping a scalar and handling IO exceptions.

After researching the newer versions of `cactoos`, it appears that the `IoCheckedScalar` class has been replaced by `IoChecked` in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. Here is the fixed class:

        this.nodes.forEach(

    @Override
    public Wallet pull(final long id) throws IOException {
        return new IoChecked<>(
            new Reduced<>(

                    c -> c::wallet,
                    new Sorted<>(new Copies(id, this))
                )
            )
        ).value();
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Remote> iterator() {
        return this.nodes.iterator();
    }
}
```

In this fix, the `IoCheckedScalar` import has been replaced with `IoChecked`, and the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` in the `pull` method has been updated to use `IoChecked`. This should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the same functionality.
