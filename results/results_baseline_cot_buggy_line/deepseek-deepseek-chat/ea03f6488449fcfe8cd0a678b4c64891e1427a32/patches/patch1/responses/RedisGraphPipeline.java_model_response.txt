1. Examine the error message:
   - The error messages indicate that several classes from the `redis.clients.jedis.commands` package cannot be found. This suggests that the package structure or class names in the Jedis library have changed in the updated version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The client code imports and extends multiple interfaces from the `redis.clients.jedis.commands` package, but these interfaces are no longer available in the updated version of the Jedis library.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The fix should involve updating the imports and the extended interfaces to match the new package structure or class names in the updated Jedis library.
   - Since the exact new package structure is not provided, we will assume that the interfaces have been moved to a different package or renamed.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the imports to use the correct package or class names from the updated Jedis library.
   - Update the extended interfaces in the `RedisGraphPipeline` class to match the new class names or package structure.

```

In this fix, I have updated the imports and the extended interfaces to use the new package structure or class names from the updated Jedis library. The `RedisGraphPipeline` interface now extends `BinaryJedisCommands`, `MultiKeyCommands`, `ClusterCommands`, `BinaryScriptingCommands`, `ScriptingCommands`, `Pipeline`, and `Closeable`. This should resolve the compilation errors caused by the breaking dependency update.
