1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the package `javax.ws.rs` and its sub-packages (`javax.ws.rs.core`) do not exist.
   - The errors occur in lines where imports from `javax.ws.rs` and `javax.ws.rs.core` are used, as well as where annotations like `@Path` and `@Produces` are applied.
   - This suggests that the `javax.ws.rs` dependency is either missing or has been updated to a different package structure.

2. Review the client code:
   - The code uses JAX-RS annotations (`@Path`, `@GET`, `@Produces`) and classes (`Response`, `MediaType`) from the `javax.ws.rs` package.
   - The error is consistent across all imports and annotations related to `javax.ws.rs`.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The issue is likely due to a breaking change in the JAX-RS API, where the package has been moved or renamed.
   - A common solution is to update the imports to use the new package structure, such as `jakarta.ws.rs` instead of `javax.ws.rs`, which is the new namespace for JAX-RS in Jakarta EE.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace all `javax.ws.rs` imports with `jakarta.ws.rs`.
   - Ensure that the annotations and classes are correctly imported from the new package.
   - No changes to the method signatures or logic are required.
