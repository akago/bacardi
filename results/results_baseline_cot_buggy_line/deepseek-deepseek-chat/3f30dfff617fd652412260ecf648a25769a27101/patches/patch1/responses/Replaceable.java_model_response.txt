1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the package `javax.interceptor` does not exist, and the symbol `InterceptorBinding` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 5 (import statement) and line 13 (annotation usage).
   - This suggests that the `javax.interceptor` package is no longer available or has been moved in the updated dependency version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the import statement `import javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding;` and the annotation `@InterceptorBinding`.
   - The `@InterceptorBinding` annotation is used to mark the `Replaceable` annotation as an interceptor binding.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `javax.interceptor` package might have been moved to `jakarta.interceptor` in newer versions of the Java EE or Jakarta EE specifications.
   - The fix would involve updating the import statement to use the new package location.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Replace `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` with `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`.
   - Ensure that the `jakarta.interceptor` package is available in the project dependencies.
