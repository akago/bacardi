<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `Matchers` from the `org.hamcrest` package cannot be found.
   - This suggests that the `hamcrest` library is either missing or has been updated in a way that changes the package structure or class names.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic import is `import org.hamcrest.Matchers;`.
   - The `Matchers` class is used in the `hasPath` and `hasQuery` methods to create matchers for URI properties.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The most likely issue is that the `hamcrest` library has been updated, and the `Matchers` class has been moved or renamed.
   - A common solution is to update the import statement to use the correct class or package.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement to use the correct class or package.
   - Ensure that the `hamcrest` library is included in the project dependencies with the correct version.

The fix involves updating the import statement from `org.hamcrest.Matchers` to `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, which is the correct package for the `Matchers` class in newer versions of the `hamcrest` library. This change ensures that the code compiles correctly with the updated dependency.
