1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the method `setContext` is not found in `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder.Builder`.
   - The class `PublishMetadata` cannot be found in the package `com.google.cloud.pubsublite`.
   - The errors suggest that the dependency version has changed, and the API has been updated.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic lines are:
     - `setContext(PubsubContext.of(FRAMEWORK))`
     - `import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;`
     - `public Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params) {`
   - The `PublishMetadata` class seems to have been moved or renamed in the newer version of the dependency.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `setContext` method might have been removed or replaced in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The `PublishMetadata` class might have been moved to a different package or renamed.
   - The fix should ensure that the correct imports and method calls are used according to the updated dependency.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statement for `PublishMetadata` to reflect its new location or name.
   - Remove or replace the `setContext` method call with the appropriate method or configuration according to the updated API.
   - Ensure that the `Publisher` interface is correctly parameterized with the updated `PublishMetadata` class.

```

In this fix:
- The `PublishMetadata` class has been replaced with `Void` in the `Publisher` interface, as it seems to have been removed or is no longer needed in the updated dependency.
- The `setContext` method call has been removed, as it is no longer part of the `SinglePartitionPublisherBuilder.Builder` API in the updated dependency.
- The rest of the class remains unchanged to ensure compatibility with the rest of the codebase.
