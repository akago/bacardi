1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `@Mapper` annotation cannot be retrieved.
   - The error occurs at line 11, where the `@Mapper` annotation is used.
   - This suggests that there might be an issue with the MapStruct dependency or its version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `@Mapper` annotation is used to define a MapStruct mapper interface.
   - The code imports `org.mapstruct.Mapper` and `org.mapstruct.factory.Mappers`, which are part of the MapStruct library.
   - The issue is likely related to the MapStruct dependency not being correctly included or an incompatible version being used.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Ensure that the correct version of MapStruct is included in the project's dependencies.
   - Verify that the `@Mapper` annotation is correctly imported from the MapStruct library.
   - If the issue persists, consider using a different version of MapStruct that is compatible with the project.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Check the project's build configuration (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven) to ensure that the correct MapStruct dependency is included.
   - If the dependency is missing or incorrect, update the build configuration to include the correct version of MapStruct.
   - Ensure that the `@Mapper` annotation is correctly imported and used in the code.

package io.github.wesleyosantos91.api.v1.mapper;

import io.github.wesleyosantos91.api.v1.request.PersonRequest;
import io.github.wesleyosantos91.api.v1.response.PersonResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import org.mapstruct.Mapper;
import org.mapstruct.factory.Mappers;

@Mapper
public interface PersonHttpMapper {

    PersonHttpMapper INSTANCE = Mappers.getMapper(PersonHttpMapper.class);
    PersonDomain toDomain(PersonRequest request);
    PersonRequest toRequest(PersonDomain domain);

    PersonDomain toDomain(PersonResponse response);
    PersonResponse toResponse(PersonDomain domain);

    default List<PersonResponse> toListResponse(List<PersonDomain> domains){
        List<PersonResponse> list = new ArrayList<>();
        domains.forEach(d-> list.add(toResponse(d)));
        return list;
    }
}
```

To fix the issue, ensure that the correct MapStruct dependency is included in your project's build configuration. For example, in a Maven `pom.xml` file, you should have:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mapstruct</groupId>
    <artifactId>mapstruct</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.5.Final</version> <!-- or the appropriate version -->
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mapstruct</groupId>
    <artifactId>mapstruct-processor</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.5.Final</version> <!-- or the appropriate version -->
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to use the correct version of MapStruct that is compatible with your project. If the issue persists, consider updating the MapStruct version to a more recent one that is known to work with your project setup.
