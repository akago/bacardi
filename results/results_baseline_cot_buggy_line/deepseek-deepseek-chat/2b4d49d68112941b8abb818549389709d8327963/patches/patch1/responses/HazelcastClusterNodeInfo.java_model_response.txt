<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class `com.hazelcast.core.Member` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs in the import statement and the constructor of `HazelcastClusterNodeInfo`.
   - This suggests that the `Member` class has been moved or renamed in the newer version of the Hazelcast library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic areas are the import statement and the constructor parameter type.
   - The `Member` class is used to retrieve attributes and the socket address of a cluster member.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The `Member` class might have been moved to a different package in the newer Hazelcast version.
   - Researching the Hazelcast documentation or release notes would help identify the new location of the `Member` class.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Update the import statement to reflect the new package location of the `Member` class.
   - Ensure the rest of the code remains unchanged to maintain compatibility with the existing functionality.
</code_analysis>

Based on the analysis, the `Member` class has likely been moved to a different package in the newer Hazelcast version. The fix involves updating the import statement to the correct package.

The fix involves updating the import statement from `com.hazelcast.core.Member` to `com.hazelcast.cluster.Member`, which is the likely new location of the `Member` class in the updated Hazelcast version. The rest of the code remains unchanged to ensure compatibility with the existing functionality.
