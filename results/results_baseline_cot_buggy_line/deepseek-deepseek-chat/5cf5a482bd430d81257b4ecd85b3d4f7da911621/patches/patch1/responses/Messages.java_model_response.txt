<code_analysis>
1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `MvcContext` cannot be found.
   - The error occurs at line 23, where `MvcContext` is declared as a field.
   - This suggests that the import statement for `MvcContext` is incorrect or missing, or the class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the declaration of the `MvcContext` field.
   - The import statement `import javax.mvc.MvcContext;` is present, but it seems to be incorrect or outdated.
   - The code is part of a Jakarta EE MVC application, and the `MvcContext` class might have been moved to a different package in the updated dependency.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - The most likely fix is to update the import statement to reflect the correct package for `MvcContext` in the newer version of the dependency.
   - The `MvcContext` class might have been moved to the `jakarta.mvc` package in the newer versions of Jakarta EE.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - Update the import statement for `MvcContext` to use the correct package.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged, as the functionality of the class should not be affected by this change.
